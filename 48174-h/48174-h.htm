<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>“Experience,” says the proverb, “is a dear school,
and none but fools learn therein.” The inference is
that to be wise one must suffer himself to be taught by
the experience of others. This volume contains the life
stories, told by themselves, of many successful men and
women, with emphasis on those experiences which to
them appear to have been the turning points in their
lives.</p>

<p>It is not likely that there is anywhere in existence a
similar collection of heart-to-heart talks with distinguished
people of equal value to this. The idea of requesting
the leaders in invention, manufacture, transportation,
commerce, finance, in political and public
life, and in the professions of the ministry, the law,
literature and art, to bequeath in their own words the
stories of their lives, their ideals, and the lessons of
their experience, to the American public, originated
with Orison Swett Marden, and contributed in no
small degree to the immediate and remarkable popularity
of <span class="smcap">Success</span>, in which many of these interviews
first appeared. The early files of the magazine are
long since exhausted, but the interest in, and demand
for, these articles is sufficient assurance that they are
of enduring merit, and deserve to be collected in permanent
form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>We regard them as a trust. We do not feel that we
have a right to withhold them from the public. We
have accordingly fulfilled our obligation by presenting
them in attractive form, and we are well assured that
young and old alike who are striving to attain their
ideals in life will recognize the fact that the highest
form of self-interest will lead them to read and absorb
the practical helpfulness contained in these pages.
Many and varied careers have been selected, so that
each one may find his ideal of success fulfilled in real
life, and be aroused to a lofty aspiration and resolute
determination to achieve like eminence. With Emerson
we say, “Hitch your wagon to a star,” and, with
Lowell, “Not failure, but low aim, is crime.”</p>

<p>While for the most part the experiences portrayed in
this book occurred upon American soil, in several instances
persons born or now living abroad, but prominently
identified with American life, have been included.</p>

<p>We acknowledge our indebtedness to the publishers
of the “Literary Digest,” of “Collier’s Weekly,”
of the “American Review of Reviews,” and others
who kindly loaned valuable photographs for reproduction,
and also to members of the <span class="smcap">Success</span>
editorial staff for valuable assistance in the preparation
of this volume.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Apelles, the great artist, traveled all over Greece for
years, studying the fairest points of beautiful women,
getting here an eye, there a forehead, and there a nose,
here a grace and there a turn of beauty, for his famous
portrait of a perfect woman which enchanted the world.
It was not a portrait, not an imaginary ideal head, but
a composite, a combination from the most perfect features
he could find. By combining the perfect points,
the graceful curves, the lines of beauty of many individuals,
he made his wonderful painting.</p>

<p>The great artist knew that all elements of beauty
and perfection of physical form could not be found in
one person. He knew, too, that some of the most perfect
features and beautiful curves would be found in
women who were on the whole anything but beautiful—perhaps
repulsive.</p>

<p>The editors of this volume have been for many years
in quest of the elements of a grand, healthy, symmetrical,
successful man—the ideal man. They knew at the
beginning that it would be impossible to find any one
man who would illustrate all these points of perfection,
who would combine in perfect degree all the success
qualities, but they have found in scores of men who
have achieved something worth while qualities which,
put together, would make a composite ideal man, a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who, in the evolution of civilization, will, perhaps,
sometime be possible. Usually, in men who have risen
to eminence, some one quality or virtue shines conspicuous,
often accompanied with defects, perhaps great
weakness, which, to gain the lesson, we must ignore.</p>

<p>The editors have found here a man illustrative of
perseverance, here one marked by undaunted ambition,
there a life where grit overcame all obstacles, and another
where the quick grasping of opportunities led to
noble achievement.</p>

<p>They have interviewed successful men and women
in the various vocations, trying to get at the secret of
their success, the reasons for their advancement. These
varied life stories will give the reader the material
for constructing the composite character—the ideal
man or woman—one that shall combine all the best
virtues and qualities, whose imitation will help to insure
a useful, profitable and honored life. This composite
man will not be a one-sided specialist. He will not be
a man cursed with any great weakness. He will be a
man raised to the highest power, symmetrical, self-centered,
equipoised, ever master of himself.</p>

<p>It does not follow that every man whose name appears
in this book is a model in every respect. Napoleon
was not a model character, and yet he exemplifies
some success qualities in his career in an almost ideal
degree.</p>

<p>What question, arising from individual experience,
from family life, or from daily observation within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
community, is of more poignant human interest than
the query: “Why do some men succeed, while others
fail?” and the allied question: “What constitutes success
in life, and how may it be attained?”</p>

<p>An analysis of the ideals and achievements of these
leaders in invention, commerce and finance, in public
affairs, and in literature, the arts, and the professions,
as set forth by themselves, seems to reveal certain
salient life lessons well worthy of most careful consideration.
First, it would appear that without exception
every successful man or woman at some period of
his or her life, whether early or late, has formed a life
purpose, and has registered a solemn vow to achieve
something more than ordinary in the world. An exception
to this rule appears to obtain in the cases of
men or women possessed of a strong natural bent or
talent, the exercise of which is an instinctive craving
that will not be denied. This determination to be or
to achieve, or this instinctive bent of thought and
action, appears to be the first indication of greatness,
and the turning point in great careers.</p>

<p>The next most obvious lesson to be drawn from a
careful study of these interviews seems to be, that once
a determination to succeed is made, and the first steps,
however humble, have been entered upon in the new
career, the subject commences to take an <i>interest</i>
amounting to positive pleasure in the tasks and duties
incident to his chosen life work.</p>

<p>The far-away goal of success, with its reward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
fame, wealth, and all that money can procure, appears
to fade from the worker’s sight as he advances toward
it, and the incitement to labor for material reward is
lost in the joy of congenial labor for its own sake.
The player loses sight of the hope of victory in the
mere zest of the game. This note appears again and
again in the life stories of great workers as revealed by
themselves, and accounts for the spectacle, so puzzling
to many, of the master of millions apparently grasping
for more millions in his declining years. There can be
no content with present achievement, however great,
because all who have achieved great things have discovered
that the ends sought are lost in the value of the
faculties developed by the search, and they hence seek,
not additional reward of toil, but rather the pleasurable
exercise of the chase. The joy of labor will not
permit men to lay down the harness and relinquish
effort this side the grave.</p>

<p>A determination to succeed once formed, and a congenial
career once chosen and entered upon, there commences
a process of character-building by the formation
of life habits. These solidify into personal characteristics,
the varying assortment of which in the
individual constitutes what we call his personality,
wherein one man differs from another. Character, it
has been wisely said, is the resultant of choices. It
appears again and again in the reminiscences of those
who have succeeded, that from time to time they have
deliberately chosen a course of action which by force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of habit has become a personal characteristic, and has
earned them national, if not world-wide, reputation.
The name of “Honest” John Wanamaker stands for a
reputation having a commercial value of hundreds of
thousands of dollars. The acorn from which grew
this mighty oak was a young man’s choice of honesty
as the foundation of his career.</p>

<p>Books and essays by the score and hundred have been
written by theorists upon the principles of success in
life. Worthy as are many of the writers, their lives
often illustrate the adage of the poet, “It were easier
to tell twenty what were good to be done than to be
one of the twenty to follow mine own teachings.”
Boldly contrasted with such writings are the flesh and
blood maxims herein contained, stamped with the mint
marks of great personalities, towering mountainous
among their fellows, each coined from the life habits
which have hardened into enduring character, and have
left their impress upon the history of our times.</p>

<p>In a drawing-room or public assemblage he would
indeed be unambitious and mean-spirited, who would
not choose the company and conversation of the greatest
and the best. Carlyle says, “Great men taken up
in any way are profitable company.” What privilege
could promise equal pleasure and profit with a series
of visits at the homes of the most notable personages
our land contains, to consult with each on the great
questions of success or failure, of what constitutes ideal
success, and of how it may be attained?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is the privilege contemplated by this volume
and freely offered to all who choose to avail themselves
of it. Compared with the inspiration, the examples
and the wise counsel contained within its covers, the
cost of such a volume sinks into insignificance. Benjamin
Franklin said that the reading of one good book
made him what he was. Henry Clay testified, “to the
fact that in the midst of her early poverty my mother
provided her home with a few choice books, do I owe
my success in life.” Senator Dolliver, in the present
volume, regards a chance-found book as the turning
point of his career, and like testimony is all but universal.
Let the young and the guardians of youth
weigh well the thought that there are sins of omission,
as well as of commission, and that it may be hardly a
less criminal negligence to refuse fit books for the
growing mind than food for the growing body.</p>

<p>Quite aside from considerations of profit and duty
are the considerations of pleasure offered by a volume
of this character. It is a truism that truth is stranger
than fiction. The romance of reality is the most thrilling
of all romances, and there is a peculiar fascination
associated with those glimpses of the inner man which
are revealed by a speaker who sets forth his own life
story, and places his own interpretation upon it. From
this view point, “Little Visits” possesses a wealth of
suggestion and of information, alike valuable and interesting
to readers of all ages and of every walk in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The dominant note of this book, is inspiration; its
keynote, helpfulness.</p>

<p>We have tried to drive home every precept and lesson
with stirring and inspiring stories of great lives
which show that men and women are the architects of
their own fortunes, and which will explode the excuses
of those who think they have no chance in life. It
shows that necessity has ever been the priceless spur
that has urged man to struggle with his destiny and
develop his greatest strength.</p>

<p>We think the reader will find in these pages the composite
character, the all-round success. We have tried
to show that there is something better than making a
living, and that is making a life—that a man may make
millions and be a failure still.</p>

<p>We have shown that a man to succeed must be
greater than his calling, that he must overtop his vocation.
We have tried to teach that the really successful
man must be greater than the book he writes, than the
patient he treats, than the goods he sells, than the cause
he pleads in the courts—that manhood is above all
titles, greater than any career.</p>

<span class="chaptertitle">Hard Work: the Secret of a Great
Inventor’s Genius.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>TO discover the opinion of Thomas A. Edison
concerning what makes and constitutes success
in life is an easy matter, if one can only discover
Mr. Edison. I camped three weeks in
the vicinity of Orange, N. J., awaiting the opportunity
to come upon the great inventor and voice my questions.
It seemed a rather hopeless and discouraging
affair until he was really before me; but, truth to say,
he is one of the most accessible of men, and only reluctantly
allows himself to be hedged in by the pressure of
endless affairs. “Mr. Edison is always glad to see any
visitor,” said a gentleman who is constantly with him,
“except when he is hot on the trail of something he has
been working for, and then it is as much as a man’s
head is worth to come in on him.” He certainly was
not hot on the trail of anything on the morning when,
for seemingly the tenth time, I rang at the gate in the
fence which surrounds the laboratory on Valley Road,
Orange. A young man appeared, who conducted me
up the walk to the elegant office and library of the
great laboratory. It is a place, this library, not to be
passed through without thought, for with a further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
store of volumes in his home, it contains one of the
most costly and well-equipped scientific libraries in the
world; the collection of writings on patent laws and
patents, for instance, is absolutely exhaustive. It gives,
at a glance, an idea of the breadth of the thought and
sympathy of this man who grew up with scarcely a
common school education.</p>

<p>On the second floor, in one of the offices of the
machine-shop, I was asked to wait, while a grimy
youth disappeared with my card, which he said he
would “slip under the door of Mr. Edison’s office.”
“Curious,” I thought; “what a lord this man must be
if they dare not even knock at his door!”</p>

<p>Thinking of this and gazing out of the window, I
waited until a working man, who had entered softly,
came up beside me. He looked with a sort of “Well,
what is it?” in his eyes, and quickly it began to come to
me that the man in the sooty, oil-stained clothes was
Edison himself. The working garb seemed rather incongruous,
but there was no mistaking the broad forehead,
with its shock of blackish hair streaked with gray.
The gray eyes, too, were revelations in the way of alert
comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>“Oh!” was all I could get out at the time.</p>

<p>“Want to see me?” he said, smiling in the most
youthful and genial way.</p>

<p>“Why,—yes, certainly, to be sure,” I stammered.</p>

<p>He looked at me blankly.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to talk louder,” said an assistant who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
worked in another portion of the room; “he don’t hear
well.”</p>


<h3>HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A BANKER.</h3>

<p>This fact was new to me, but I raised my voice with
celerity and piped thereafter in an exceedingly shrill
key. After the usual humdrum opening remarks, in
which he acknowledged with extreme good nature his
age as fifty-five years, and that he was born in Erie
county, O., of Dutch parentage, the family having emigrated
to America in 1730, the particulars began to
grow more interesting. His great-grandfather, I learned,
was a banker of high standing in New York; and,
when Thomas was but a child of seven years, the family
fortune suffered reverses so serious as to make it necessary
that he should become a wage-earner at an unusually
early age, and that the family should move from
his birth-place to Michigan.</p>

<p>“Did you enjoy mathematics as a boy?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not much,” he replied. “I tried to read Newton’s
‘Principia’ at the age of eleven. That disgusted me
with pure mathematics, and I don’t wonder now. I
should not have been allowed to take up such serious
work.”</p>

<p>“You were anxious to learn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. I attempted to read through the entire
Free Library at Detroit, but other things interfered
before I had done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Were you a book-worm and dreamer?” I
questioned.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he answered, using a short, jerky
method, as though he were unconsciously checking
himself up. “I became a newsboy, and liked the work.
Made my first <i>coup</i> as a newsboy.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“I bought up on ‘futures’ a thousand copies of the
‘Detroit Free Press’ containing important war news,—gained
a little time on my rivals, and sold the entire
batch like hot cakes. The price reached twenty-five
cents a copy before the end of the route,” and he
laughed. “I ran the ‘Grand Trunk Herald,’ too, at that
time—a little paper I issued from the train.”</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>“When did you begin to be interested in inventions?”
I questioned.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I began to dabble in chemistry at
that time. I fitted up a small laboratory on the train.”</p>

<p>In reference to this, Mr. Edison subsequently admitted
that, during the progress of some occult experiments
in this workshop, certain complications ensued
in which a jolted and broken bottle of sulphuric acid
attracted the attention of the conductor. He, who had
been long suffering in the matter of unearthly odors,
promptly ejected the young devotee and all his works.
This incident would have been only amusing but for
its relation to and explanation of his deafness. A box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
on the ear, administered by the irate conductor, caused
the lasting deafness.</p>

<p>“What was your first work in a practical line?” I
went on.</p>

<p>“A telegraph line between my home and another
boy’s, I made with the help of an old river cable, some
stove-pipe wire, and glass-bottle insulators. I had my
laboratory in the cellar and studied telegraphy outside.”</p>

<p>“What was the first really important thing you did?”</p>

<p>“I saved a boy’s life.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“The boy was playing on the track near the depot. I
saw he was in danger and caught him, getting out of
the way just in time. His father was station-master,
and taught me telegraphy in return.”</p>

<p>Dramatic situations appear at every turn of this man’s
life, though, temperamentally, it is evident that he
would be the last to seek them. He seems to have been
continually arriving on the scene at critical moments,
and always with the good sense to take things in his
own hands. The chance of learning telegraphy only
gave him a chance to show how apt a pupil he was, and
the railroad company soon gave him regular employment.
He himself admits that, at seventeen, he had
become one of the most expert operators on the road.</p>

<p>“Did you make much use of your inventive talent at
this time?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “I invented an automatic attachment
for my telegraph instrument which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
send in the signal to show I was awake at my post,
when I was comfortably snoring in a corner. I didn’t
do much of that, though,” he went on; “for some such
boyish trick sent me in disgrace over the line into
Canada.”</p>


<h3>A NOVEL METHOD OF TELEGRAPHING.</h3>

<p>“Were you there long?”</p>

<p>“Only a winter. If it’s incident you want, I can tell
you one of that time. The place where I was and
Sarnia, the American town, were cut off from telegraph
and other means of communication by the storms
until I got at a locomotive whistle and tooted a telegraphic
message. I had to do it again and again, but
eventually they understood it over the water and answered
in the same way.”</p>

<p>According to his own and various recorded accounts,
Edison was successively in charge of important wires
in Memphis, Cincinnati, New Orleans and Louisville.
He lived in the free-and-easy atmosphere of the tramp
operators—a boon companion with them, yet absolutely
refusing to join in the dissipations to which they were
addicted. So highly esteemed was he for his honesty
that it was the custom of his colleagues, when a spree
was on hand, to make him the custodian of those funds
which they felt obliged to save. On a more than usually
hilarious occasion, one of them returned rather the
worse for wear, and knocked the treasurer down on his
refusal to deliver the trust money; the other depositors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
we are glad to note, gave the ungentlemanly tippler
a sound thrashing.</p>

<p>“Were you good at saving your own money?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, smiling. “I never was much for saving
money, as money. I devoted every cent, regardless
of future needs, to scientific books and materials for
experiments.”</p>

<p>“You believe that an excellent way to succeed?”</p>

<p>“Well, it helped me greatly to future success.”</p>

<p>“What was your next invention?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“An automatic telegraph recorder—a machine which
enabled me to record dispatches at leisure, and send
them off as fast as needed.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to hit upon that?”</p>

<p>“Well, at the time, I was in such straits that I had to
walk from Memphis to Louisville. At the Louisville
station they offered me a place. I had perfected a style
of handwriting which would allow me to take legibly
from the wire, long hand, forty-seven and even fifty-four
words a minute, but I was only a moderately rapid
sender. I had to do something to help me on that side,
and so I thought out that little device.”</p>

<p>Later, he pointed out an article by one of his biographers,
in which a paragraph, referring to this Louisville
period, says:—</p>

<p>“True to his dominant instincts, he was not long in
gathering around him a laboratory, printing office and
machine shop. He took press reports during his whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stay, including, on one occasion, the Presidential message,
by Andrew Johnson, and this at one sitting, from
3:30 <small>P. M.</small> to 4:30 <small>A. M.</small></p>

<p>“He then paragraphed the matter he had received
over the wires, so that printers had exactly three lines
each, thus enabling them to set up a column in two or
three minutes’ time. For this, he was allowed all the
exchanges he desired, and the Louisville press gave
him a state dinner.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage to attract public attention to
your ability?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t manage,” said the Wizard. “Some things
I did created comment. A device that I invented which
utilized one submarine cable for two circuits, caused
considerable talk, and the Franklin telegraph office of
Boston gave me a position.”</p>

<p>It is related of this, Mr. Edison’s first trip east, that
he came with no ready money and in a rather dilapidated
condition. His colleagues were tempted by his
“hayseed” appearance to “salt” him, as professional
slang terms the process of giving a receiver matter
faster than he can record it. For this purpose, the new
man was assigned to a wire manipulated by a New
York operator famous for his speed. But there was no
fun at all. Notwithstanding the fact that the New
Yorker was in the game and was doing his most speedy
clip, Edison wrote out the long message accurately, and,
when he realized the situation, was soon firing taunts
over the wire at the sender’s slowness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>


<h3>HIS FIRST PATENT.</h3>

<p>“Had you patented many things up to the time of
your coming east?” I queried.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said the inventor, ruminatively. “I received
my first patent in 1869.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“A machine for recording votes and designed to be
used in the State Legislature.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know such machines were in use,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“They ar’n’t,” he answered, with a merry twinkle.
“The better it worked, the more impossible it was; the
sacred right of the minority, you know,—couldn’t filibuster
if they used it,—didn’t use it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was an ingenious thing. Votes were clearly
pointed and shown on a roll of paper, by a small
machine attached to the desk of each member. I was
made to learn that such an innovation was out of the
question, but it taught me something.”</p>

<p>“And that was?”</p>

<p>“To be sure of the practical need of, and demand for,
a machine, before expending time and energy on it.”</p>

<p>“Is that one of your maxims of success?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>In this same year, Edison came from Boston to New
York, friendless and in debt on account of the expenses
of his experiment. For several weeks he wandered
about the town with actual hunger staring him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
face. It was a time of great financial excitement, and
with that strange quality of Fortunism, which seems to
be his chief characteristic, he entered the establishment
of the Law Gold Reporting Company just as their
entire plant had shut down on account of an accident
in the machinery that could not be located. The heads
of the firm were anxious and excited to the last degree,
and a crowd of the Wall street fraternity waited about
for the news which came not. The shabby stranger put
his finger on the difficulty at once, and was given lucrative
employment. In the rush of the metropolis, a man
finds his true level without delay, especially when his
talents are of so practical and brilliant a nature as were
this young telegrapher’s. It would be an absurdity to
imagine an Edison hidden in New York. Within a
short time, he was presented with a check for $40,000,
as his share of a single invention—an improved stock
printer. From this time, a national reputation was
assured him. He was, too, now engaged upon the
duplex and quadruplex systems—systems for sending
two and four messages at the same time over a single
wire,—which were to inaugurate almost a new era in
telegraphy.</p>


<h3>POVERTY AS AN INCENTIVE TO EFFORT.</h3>

<p>Recalling the incident of the Law Gold Reporting
Company, I inquired: “Do you believe want urges a
man to greater efforts and so to greater success?”</p>

<p>“It certainly makes him keep a sharp lookout. I
think it does push a man along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you believe that invention is a gift, or an
acquired ability?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s born in a man.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you believe that familiarity with certain
mechanical conditions and defects naturally suggest
improvements to any one?”</p>

<p>“No. Some people may be perfectly familiar with a
machine all their days, knowing it inefficient, and never
see a way to improve it.”</p>

<p>“What do you think is the first requisite for success
in your field, or any other?”</p>

<p>“The ability to apply your physical and mental
energies to one problem incessantly without growing
weary.”</p>

<p>“Do you have regular hours, Mr. Edison?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, “I do not work hard now. I come to
the laboratory about eight o’clock every day and go
home to tea at six, and then I study or work on some
problem until eleven, which is my hour for bed.”</p>

<p>“Fourteen or fifteen hours a day can scarcely be
called loafing,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “for fifteen years I have worked
on an average of twenty hours a day.”</p>

<p>That astonishing brain has been known to puzzle
itself for sixty consecutive hours over a refractory problem,
its owner dropping quietly off into a long sleep
when the job was done, to awake perfectly refreshed
and ready for another siege. Mr. Dickson, a neighbor
and familiar, gives an anecdote told by Edison which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
well illustrates his untiring energy and phenomenal endurance.
In describing his Boston experience, Edison
said he bought Faraday’s works on electricity, commenced
to read them at three o’clock in the morning
and continued until his room-mate arose, when they
started on their long walk to get breakfast. That object
was entirely subordinated in Edison’s mind to Faraday,
and he suddenly remarked to his friend: “Adams, I
have got so much to do, and life is so short, that I have
got to hustle,” and with that he started off on a dead
run for his breakfast.</p>


<h3>NEVER DID ANYTHING WORTH WHILE BY CHANCE.</h3>

<p>“Are your discoveries often brilliant intuitions? Do
they come to you while you are lying awake nights?” I
asked him.</p>

<p>“I never did anything worth doing by accident,” he
replied, “nor did any of my inventions come indirectly
through accident, except the phonograph. No, when I
have fully decided that a result is worth getting, I go
about it, and make trial after trial, until it comes.</p>

<p>“I have always kept,” continued Mr. Edison, “strictly
within the lines of commercially useful inventions. I
have never had any time to put on electrical wonders,
valuable only as novelties to catch the popular fancy.”</p>

<p>“What makes you work?” I asked with real curiosity.
“What impels you to this constant, tireless struggle?
You have shown that you care comparatively
nothing for the money it makes you, and you have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
particular enthusiasm for the attending fame. What
is it?”</p>

<p>“I like it,” he answered, after a moment of puzzled
expression. “I don’t know any other reason. Anything
I have begun is always on my mind, and I am not
easy while away from it, until it is finished; and then
I hate it.”</p>

<p>“Hate it?” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he affirmed, “when it is all done and is a success,
I can’t bear the sight of it. I haven’t used a telephone
in ten years, and I would go out of my way any
day to miss an incandescent light.”</p>

<p>“You lay down rather severe rules for one who
wishes to succeed in life,” I ventured, “working eighteen
hours a day.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he said. “You do something all day
long, don’t you? Every one does. If you get up at
seven o’clock and go to bed at eleven, you have put in
sixteen good hours, and it is certain with most men
that they have been doing something all the time. They
have been either walking, or reading, or writing, or
thinking. The only trouble is that they do it about a
great many things and I do it about one. If they took
the time in question and applied it in one direction, to
one object, they would succeed. Success is sure to follow
such application. The trouble lies in the fact that
people do not have an object—one thing to which they
stick, letting all else go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<h3>OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE INVENTORS.</h3>

<p>“You believe, of course,” I suggested, “that much
remains to be discovered in the realm of electricity?”</p>

<p>“It is the field of fields,” he answered. “We can’t
talk of that, but it holds the secret which will reorganize
the life of the world.”</p>

<p>“You have discovered much about it,” I said,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “and yet very little in comparison
with the possibilities that appear.”</p>

<p>“How many inventions have you patented?”</p>

<p>“Only six hundred,” he answered, “but I have made
application for some three hundred more.”</p>

<p>“And do you expect to retire soon, after all this?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” he said, almost pathetically. “I hope I
will be able to work right on to the close. I shouldn’t
care to loaf.”</p>

<p>Shouldn’t care to loaf! What a thought after fifty-two
years of such magnificent achievement.</p>


<h3>THE WIZARD AT HOME.</h3>

<p>While the inventions of Thomas A. Edison keep him
constantly in the public eye, as a man in private life he
is comparatively unknown. If you should see him in
his laboratory, buried deep in work, surrounded by battalions
of machines and hosts of experimental appliances,
dressed in his “shop clothes” spotted with
chemicals, you would never suspect that, just seven
hundred feet away, a palatial home awaits him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten years ago he was an undomesticated man. His
workshop and his chemical laboratory held such powerful
sway over his mind that he was only supremely
happy when “up to his eyes” in work. Gradually,
almost insidiously, the “wizard” has been weaned away
from the weaving of his spells, and now a new and
more potent power than ever before controlled him has
gained its mastery over him. This is the power of love.
Though the great inventor even now works as few men
of his age and accomplishments are in the habit of
doing, the last few years have seen a steady relaxation
of his toil. The time has passed when he was wont to
lock himself in a room and work sixty hours at a stretch
without taking more than an hour’s sleep at various
intervals in that time.</p>


<h3>MRS. EDISON IS ALSO AN INVENTOR OF GOOD ABILITY.</h3>

<p>When Mr. Edison toils now, there is one who shares
his labors with him. It is Mrs. Edison, his second
wife. She is the daughter of John Miller, who invented
the famous Miller mowing machine, and inherits a
great deal of inventive ability. It is through this additional
bond of genius that they are united. She is a
helpmeet in the true sense of the word. It is said that
they are now working on an invention which they will
patent jointly.</p>

<p>Whether Mrs. Edison intends to participate in one
of her husband’s inventions or not, she takes more than
passing interest in all of his affairs, and has acquired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
through her association with him, a vast amount of
electrical and mechanical knowledge. When Mr. Edison
met Miss Miller, twelve years ago, he was at the
beginning of his fame. It was one of the most intensely
busy periods of his career, his work engaging
nearly every moment of his time.</p>

<p>The days of complete absorption in work have passed
for him. His home-life has become necessary to him.
Though he has had one or two relapses of “working
fever,”—when he steadfastly refused to be moved from
the laboratory by Mrs. Edison’s persuasions,—he has
reached the period when he is glad to go to his home.
Much honor is due to the woman who has wrought so
marvelous a change in her husband. Those who knew
Mr. Edison best predicted that his present wife would
soon become a secondary consideration in his life. They
are, from all accounts, mistaken.</p>

<p>The Edison home is one of the finest residences in
New Jersey, and is furnished with all the conveniences
and luxuries of a modern palace. It bears evidence of
Mrs. Edison’s true taste and skillful management. The
lower floor of the house is laid out in parlors, conservatories,
and a magnificent dining room. Ponderous
chandeliers bristling with electric-light bulbs hang from
ceilings finished in open-work beams, exhibiting the best
art of the builder. Mr. Edison has a fine library in his
residence, though it does not contain so many scientific
works as the library at his laboratory.</p>

<p>The upper floors are given up to sleeping rooms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a special “den” for Mr. Edison. There he works out
his plans, and has at hand the reference books he desires
in chemistry, physics, heat, light, and electricity.</p>


<h3>RISES EARLY AND WORKS LONG.</h3>

<p>He is an early riser, and is ready for work at half-past
six o’clock. His first daily occupation is to read
the newspapers. He is anxious to know if the reporters
who interviewed him wrote just what he said, for he
dislikes, above all else, newspaper interviews that are
not correct. He does not like to be misquoted, and is
willing to go to any amount of trouble in order that his
statements shall be reported without error. No matter
how busily he may be engaged at the laboratory he will
stop to look over an interview, and no one is more willing
than he is to set a reporter right.</p>

<p>At half-past seven in the morning Mr. Edison starts
for the laboratory. He usually walks, as the distance
is short, and his physicians have ordered that he must
take a certain amount of physical exercise every day.
When he reaches the laboratory, he begins with a great
rush, and starts men on certain phases of work which
he planned the previous day. He usually has from fifty
to seventy-five subjects on which he puts men to work.
These subjects he prepares at home, between the time
when he leaves the laboratory, half-past six, and midnight.</p>

<p>Every afternoon Mrs. Edison calls for her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at the laboratory, and takes him away in her carriage,
and they drive about the beautiful district of the
Oranges.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edison has undertaken the task of keeping the
inventor healthy. She will not permit him to neglect
his meals, or to work more than she thinks is good for
him. She insists that he shall leave the laboratory at a
certain hour each night, and she undertakes to personally
see that he does so. At times, Mr. Edison objects,
but in a very mild way, to this <i>régime</i>. Not long ago,
he was deeply engaged in a certain experiment, when
Mrs. Edison called for him and insisted upon taking
him home. After some resistance, he at last consented,
saying, however, by way of a final protest, as he stepped
into the carriage:—</p>

<p>“Billy” (his pet name for Mrs. Edison), “you’re a
nuisance.”</p>

<p>Were it not, however, for the saving influence which
Mrs. Edison exercises over her husband, it is doubtful
if he would accomplish so much.</p>

<p>Two armed men, although hostile, will hesitate
to attack one another; each will be careful to make
no false move, lest the other’s hand fly to his pistol

and continue to hate.</p>

<p>It is often thus with nations.</p>

<p>When I asked Mr. Maxim how one feels to be in the
business of making machines of war,—machines for
killing men by the brigade, so to speak, he replied:—</p>

<p>“Men of my profession do more to keep peace on
earth than all the churches of Christendom. They beg
for peace,—we compel it.”</p>

<p>Almost all famous men have two sides; the one is

all, and is cold and glazed and more or less characterless,—being
wholly intellectual. The other is the warm
human side, full of points of strength and lovable weaknesses.</p>

<h3>THE MAN WHOSE GUNS WILL CLEAR A JUNGLE.</h3>

<p>Hiram S. Maxim is of this type. Mention his name
to your neighbor, and he will say: “Oh, yes! Maxim,—he’s
the inventor of the rapid-fire gun, the flying
machine, and smokeless powder, and a lot of other
things.” That’s all he knows about him, and, very
likely, it’s all he cares. But the name Maxim is of tremendous
import to every nation in the world; it is
liable to have a potential influence in changing some of
their boundaries, too. China had a good supply of
rapid-fire guns when the war broke out between her and
Japan, but the brass parts had all been stolen by traitorous
Celestials, and the instruments left unfit for use.
Otherwise, the results might have been different,—who
can tell?</p>

<p>Ask the British Government how many British lives
and how much British money was saved by the rapid-fire
guns in South Africa. Also ask the “blacks” what
they think of one of them. They call it “Johnny pop,—pop,—pop.”
But these guns were small affairs. Remember
what their big brothers did for us at Santiago
and Manila. I am told that they lashed the surface of
the ocean into foam.</p>

<p>But let us look at the man as the public sees him.</p>

<p>Weigh the significance of his list of titles: Chevalier
of the Legion of Honor, member of the American Society
of Civil Engineers, honorary member of the
Bridgeport Scientific Society, member of the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Society of Arts, of the English Society of Mechanical
Engineers, of the English Society of Electrical Engineers,
of the English Society of Junior Engineers, of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
of the British Empire League, of the Decimal Society,
of the British Æronautical Society, of the London
Chamber of Commerce, and also recipient of decorations
from the Emperor of China and several European
sovereigns.</p>


<h3>HIS BRAIN IS BUILT UP OF INVENTIVE CELLS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Maxim was the first man in the world to make
an automatic gun; that is, a gun that loads and fires
itself by its own reactionary force. He was also the
first to combine gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine in a
smokeless powder. The practicability of his flying
machine is yet to be proved.</p>

<p>Such is Maxim, the ghost of whose presence appears
to bellicose rulers and bids them halt,—and they do
halt. It is said that the British Government and Hiram
S. Maxim are two of the world’s most powerful influences
for peace.</p>

<p>Next consider the human being,—the big, brown-eyed,
white-bearded man, over sixty years young,—for
he was born in Maine, in 1840.</p>

<p>He seems to me to be a man with two ambitions:
primarily, to keep on inventing, and, secondarily, to be
the most famous inventor of all ages. His intellect and
energy demand progress, his vanity demands fame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
He doesn’t appear to care for money, save as a means
to a desired end. His personality might be considered
unbalanced. His sense of self-suppression does not
correspond with his fairly colossal intellect. The character
of his intellectuality is uniform. The philosophical
rather than the scholarly instinct dominates it. Another
evidence of his quality of humanity is his sensitiveness
to unfair censure. “I don’t fear truthful criticism,”
he once said; “misrepresentation is what hurts.”</p>

<p>It is difficult for one who knows him to imagine anything
which he could not master. I once asked him the
question, and he said he believed he would have succeeded
at anything, except as a clergyman or a physician;
that his religious views would preclude the former,
and that he had a distaste for the latter.</p>


<h3>BITING OFF THE DOG’S TAIL.</h3>

<p>At the age of fourteen young Maxim left school, and
became apprenticed to a carriage-builder, although he
had previously learned the use of tools in his father’s
mill. He was a stockily built lad, and was noted for
his physical strength and daring. His father was not
an ardent advocate of “turn the other cheek” policy.
On the contrary, he used to say: “If any one assails
you, sail into him.” Once Hiram’s father promised to
bring him a present if he would be good. The little
fellow, then six years old, looked forward to the fulfilment
with impatience. At length, the elder Maxim,
returning from the village, brought a puppy as a playmate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for his little son. Hiram regarded the animal with
amazement for a few moments; then, bursting into
tears, he rushed to hide his face in his mother’s lap,
exclaiming: “I am afraid of it, it looks so much like a
dog.” The two finally became great friends. One day
the dog bit Hiram, and the lad asked his father what
he ought to do under the circumstances. “Bite him
back,” was the verdict. In pursuit of this suggestion,
the lad examined the dog and concluded that the end
of his tail was about the most vulnerable point. Accordingly,
he took that member between his teeth and
began to put on pressure, raising the dog from the
ground, in order to swing him once or twice. All the
while the lad had tears in his eyes, for he loved his little
play-fellow; but, with true Puritanical instinct, he
deemed the chastisement just and necessary. The dog,
however, did not join him in this view of the matter,
and, in an attempt to escape, carried away one of his
young master’s upper front teeth. It is also said that
one of Hiram’s young brothers, in pursuit of this policy
of retaliation, almost decapitated the family goose,
which they were saving up for Christmas, which had
savagely attacked the calf of the youngster’s leg.</p>

<p>It is easier to give Mr. Maxim’s manner of speech
than his manner of speaking. He has wonderful brown
eyes,—very honest eyes,—that stare at you inquiringly
as he talks, and an extremely gentle voice of an almost
hypnotic quality,—very attractive and soothing. Marvelously
quick-witted himself, he has little patience with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dullness in others. His power of explanation, too, is
very great. He always uses language and methods
according to the understanding of the listener. With a
scientific man, he employs forms of speech that convey
much in little, while to the ordinary layman he expresses
himself in popular English.</p>

<p>“To what do you attribute your early success?” Mr.
Maxim was asked.</p>

<p>“In the first place, I was a very large and strong
boy, and, no matter where I worked, I always succeeded
in doing more than any other man or boy in the shop.
I was never absent from work or school.”</p>


<h3>PAT’S ANXIETY TO TRY “THE BOSS,” AND ITS RESULT.</h3>

<p>The development of his physical strength kept pace
with that of his intellect. When he was thirty-five, he
was manager of a large manufactory in Brooklyn. One
day a herculean Irishman, who had long been ambitious
to have a trial of strength with “the boss,” asked the
latter how it was that the Irish were so much stronger
than the Americans.</p>

<p>“How much can you lift?” asked Mr. Maxim, quietly.</p>

<p>“Six hundred pounds,” replied Pat.</p>

<p>“And how much do you weigh?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Maxim, “I will lift you and your load
together,” and he did it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOW THE MAINE “BACKWOODSMAN” CAPTURED A ROBBER.</h3>

<p>On another occasion, while taking lunch at a railroad
station in France, Mr. Maxim recognized a notorious
confidence man who had, years before, robbed him in
Paris. The fellow, seeing that he was detected, tried
to escape by leaping upon a moving train. Maxim followed
and a fierce struggle ensued on the footboard of
the coach, while the train was running at a high speed.
Maxim had to fight both the fellow and his comrades,
but he subjugated his man. The train was brought to
a standstill, and the victor marched his prisoner back
over the ties to the station, delivering him to the
authorities, and subsequently had the satisfaction of
seeing him sentenced to several years at hard labor.
This was one result of the backwoods training in
Maine.</p>

<p>“Whatever job I was at,” Mr. Maxim told me, “I
used to work at and think of day and night. I talked
shop in season and out. If I was given work that was
not good enough for me, I would do it so well and so
quickly that they thought I was worthy of something
better. No matter where I was, I managed, somehow,
to get to the top. I noticed, the first thing, that the
majority of the men around me were poor and the few
rich; and I knew, of course, that the methods of the
former were wrong, and that, consequently, the way to
succeed was to follow the latter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“When did you first begin to invent?”</p>

<p>“Almost before I learned to walk. When I went to
work, I began to study out ways of improving tools and
appliances.”</p>


<h3>FROM GAS MACHINES TO INCANDESCENT LAMPS.</h3>

<p>“What were your first practical inventions?”</p>

<p>“In 1862-63 I was at work at Fitchburg, Massachusetts,
making gas machines. I made various improvements
at that time, which afterward came into general
use. From Fitchburg I went to Boston, where I entered
the service of Oliver P. Drake, who was not only a
gas-machine maker, but also a philosophical-instrument
maker. I first worked as a draughtsman, and then became
his foreman. I learned from Mr. Drake many
things that were useful to me in after life. From Boston
I came to New York, where I obtained a situation
as draughtsman at the Novelty Iron Works, East
Twelfth street. At that time they were building the
Pacific Mail steamers. Shortly after this, I thought of
a new system of making gas from gasoline. All the
machines that had existed would maintain only one
hundred lights or less, and the density and illuminating
power of the gas varied so much as to make the lights
very unsatisfactory. I decided to make a machine that
would make the gas, from first to last, of an equal density.
I made this machine and patented it. It was intended
for large consumers, and several were purchased
by A. T. Stewart &amp; Company. One of them was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Park Avenue Hotel, and, for a time, another was used
in the Post Office in New York City. I also made a
very large machine, the biggest ever made, for the
Grand Union and several other hotels at Saratoga
which belonged to A. T. Stewart. From gas machines
I turned my attention to small steam motors, and had a
place in Centre street, which is still in existence, my
successors being Messrs. Welch and Lawson, 205 Centre
street. I soon began to experiment with electricity,
and was the first man to file at the Patent Office an
invention for building up and preserving the carbons
of incandescent lamps, by the action of hydro-carbon
vapors. I lost this patent, however, by a system of
fraud, which I will not describe to-day. I was the first
man to make an electrical regulator, and exhibited it at
the Paris Exposition in 1881, and was made a Chevalier
of the French Legion of Honor. I secured many
patents on electrical inventions from 1880 to 1885. I
next experimented with automatic firearms.”</p>


<h3>THE GENESIS OF THE AUTOMATIC GUN.</h3>

<p>“How did you come to invent the automatic gun?”</p>

<p>“Many years ago, while firing at a target with a military
musket, I was much surprised at the force of the
recoil. It appeared to me that this waste of energy
might be profitably employed in loading and firing the
weapon, but it was not until I went to Europe and
found myself in Paris with insufficient work to keep
me fully employed, that I tried to make an automatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
gun. I first made a drawing, which I afterward took
to London; and, having obtained and equipped a small
factory there, I commenced experiments with the view
of evolving a gun which would load and fire itself.
There were no data to refer to. No one had ever before
spent a single cent in experimenting with automatic
guns. I first thought of employing the recoil to working
existing forms of mechanism, but found that impracticable.
I then designed and constructed a totally new
machine and a totally new system of feeding.</p>

<p>“In the spring of 1884, I constructed the first apparatus
ever made in which the recoil of one cartridge
would load another cartridge into the barrel and fire it.
This is now in the South Kensington Museum, in London,
labeled: ‘This apparatus loads and fires itself, by
force of its own recoil, and is the first machine ever
made in which energy from the burning powder is employed
for loading and firing the arm.’</p>

<p>“When I made my first gun and found that it would
really load and fire itself, I knew it would have a great
future. A few friends came in to see it. They told
others, and very soon a great number of people came
to see the new wonder. In fact, everybody, from the
Prince of Wales down, came to see the gun and fire it.
No less than two hundred thousand rounds of ammunition
were used in explaining the gun and showing it to
visitors. At first, no one would believe that an automatic
gun had really been made. No one was prepared
to believe, without seeing it. In fact, I may say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
they were unable to understand that the gun actually
loaded and fired itself. It was considered a nine days’
wonder. The English Government was the first to give
an order. It asked for a gun which would not weigh
over one hundred pounds, and would fire four hundred
rounds per minute. I made one that weighed forty
pounds and fired two thousand rounds in three minutes,
with one pull of the trigger. This is a result that no
one else has ever attained. I showed my gun to Lord
Wolseley at Hythe, where I fired at a target. That
leader and Colonel Tongue were standing by the gun
while I was firing it. I heard the latter say that it was
the best firing that had ever been seen; that the accuracy
was much better than had ever been known before;
and that the rapidity of fire was without parallel.
Everyone seemed astonished, and it was then that Lord
Wolseley approached me and said: ‘Mr. Maxim, I
have seen your gun. It is simply wonderful. It is the
most remarkable invention I ever saw in my life, and I
congratulate you heartily upon your success; but,’ he
continued, ‘it is of no good, as you will observe that the
cloud of smoke is very large indeed. Unless you can get
smokeless powder, I am afraid your gun will be of little
use.’ It was then that I began to think in earnest about
smokeless powder, one of the directors having said that
I was just the man to invent it. When I told him that
I was not a chemist at all, as compared with Professors
Fred. Adel and Dewar, his reply was: ‘You know all
the chemistry that is necessary in the matter, and, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
you have an imagination, and the others have not.
If you take the matter up, I am sure you will go ahead
of them.’”</p>


<h3>AUTOMATIC GUNS MADE SMOKELESS POWDER INDISPENSABLE.</h3>

<p>“Such was really the case, because I find that my
application for a patent for a smokeless powder, consisting
of nitro-glycerine and gun cotton, was filed at
the patent office about fourteen days ahead of any other,
and Sir Richard Webster, in speaking for the government
in the celebrated case of Nobel against the Government
on smokeless powder, said: ‘H. S. Maxim is
the first man to make a smokeless powder with nitro-glycerine
and gun cotton. This powder was taken out
to the States as much as eight or nine years ago, shown
at Springfield, and put into competition with all other
forms; and, according to the printed reports of the
time, it was said to be superior to all others at all points,
and I may say that the powder has not been improved
on to any extent, as all the leading powders of to-day
are practically the same as that invented by him at that
time.’</p>

<p>“I was the first man to show a thoroughly good
smokeless powder in the United States. Having succeeded
in England, I took my guns abroad. Switzerland
was the first country where I had a competitive
trial with other makers. I was asked to fire at a dummy
battery of artillery, at thirteen hundred yards, for one
minute; but, as a matter of fact, I was only engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
half a minute in actual firing, when it was telephoned
that I had technically killed three-fourths of the men
and horses. I thought, perhaps, that I ought to have
killed the whole of them, but the general said with
great enthusiasm: ‘No gun ever made has ever done
anything like that. It is the most marvelous thing that
has ever been done. It is simply amazing. A little gun
weighing only fifty pounds puts a battery of artillery
out of action in half a minute, at thirteen hundred
yards.’</p>

<p>“I next took the gun to Italy, where I won another
victory, and then returned to England. I received very
large orders from all these countries, and the gun is
now in use, I may say, nearly all over the world. These
guns are being made not only by our own company,
which has many factories in England, but by the British
Government, by Ludwig Loewe, of Berlin; by
Krupp, by Armstrong and by the United States Government
at Washington. The company with which I
am connected is a very large one, and we make about
sixty varieties of rapid-firing and automatic guns. We
are also makers of very large guns, builders of battleships,
etc. I have also made guns for flying aerial torpedoes,
by the use of compressed air and gas. About
ten years ago I conducted a series of experiments at
Baldwin Park, Bexley, England, with a view of ascertaining
how much power is required to perform artificial
flight. These experiments were on a much larger
scale than had ever been attempted before, and excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a great deal of interest in the scientific world. Lord
Kelvin, at the Oxford meeting of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, Lord Salisbury in
the chair, spoke in the highest terms of these experiments.
He was very enthusiastic at what he had seen at
Baldwin’s Park. He said that the work was all exceedingly
well done, that the experiments were conducted
with great care, and that they were very creditable to
me.”</p>


<h3>HOW LI HUNG CHANG BECAME INTERESTED IN MAXIM.</h3>

<p>“I have been decorated by the President of France,
by the Sultan of Turkey, by the Queen of Spain, and
by the King of Portugal, etc.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to be decorated by the Emperor
of China, Mr. Maxim?”</p>

<p>“On one occasion, when there was great excitement
in London about a terrible massacre of missionaries in
China, I attended a meeting which, at the beginning,
was very much in favor of the missionaries and against
the Chinese, but I made a speech from the Chinese
standpoint and succeeded in getting a resolution passed
about as follows: ‘This meeting regrets exceedingly
that the American and English Missionary Societies
will persist in sending missionaries to China to attack
the ancient faith of the Chinese, and we are very sorry
that the missionaries will not remain in their own countries,
and allow the Chinese to enjoy their own religion
in their own way in their own country.’ My speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was taken down in shorthand and sent to the Chinese
Ambassador. He had it nicely written out in Chinese,
beautifully bound, and sent it to Li Hung Chang. The
latter sent it to the Emperor, and the Emperor gave me
a decoration.”</p>


<h3>HOW A FIRST-CLASS FRAUD WAS EXPOSED.</h3>

<p>“Tell about the exposure of the Dowe scheme.”</p>

<p>“Some years ago a Hoboken barkeeper and a German
tailor went to England to exploit the soundness of the
alleged bullet-proof cloth. A whole town was placarded,
to advertise Dowe’s wonderful bullet-proof cloth,
etc. The invention was shown at the El Cambria Theatre,
and a great many of the old military men of England
went to see this wonderful invention, for the secret
of which the supposed inventors demanded two hundred
thousand pounds. The thing actually shown,
however, was not bullet-proof cloth, neither was it a
bullet-proof coat, but a little shield about the size and
thickness of a railway cushion, which was apparently
of fibrous material, and would stop a bullet. A target
was marked on a piece of paper, and a piece of paper
folded over the gun. One of these pieces of paper fell
into my hands. I saw where the bullet had entered,
and where the flash came out. This was a complete
‘give away,’ as it showed exactly what was in the plan,
viz., that it was a piece of sharp deception. I then put
a notice in the paper that I had discovered a shield,
steel, better than that of Herr Dowe; that his weighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
twelve and one-half pounds to the square foot, and mine
only ten; that he asked two hundred thousand pounds
for his secret, whereas I would sell mine for seven shillings,
sixpence. A great crowd of people came to see
my supposed invention, and I showed the exact thing
that Herr Dowe had, except that mine was thinner and
lighter. I had used nickel steel where he had used
chrome steel. Many people were very much disappointed,
and many of them blackguarded me in the
papers, but there was truth in all I said. I did exactly
what I said I would, and beat Herr Dowe in the point
of weight. This exposed the whole thing, and, at the
end of three days, everybody in London knew that Herr
Dowe and the Hoboken barkeeper had been deceiving
the public. In fact, one of their own men revealed the
secret, confessing that it was nothing more nor less
than a piece of steel with a cushion around it. Then
the newspaper men who had been abusing me roundly,
because they did not understand, in the first place, invited
me to London to a dinner, and Herr Dowe and
the Hoboken barkeeper disappeared.”</p>

<p>“To what do you attribute your success?”</p>

<p>“I never tried to exploit an invention till I had one to
exploit. That is, I never asked anyone to invest in a
theory; and I never allowed my name to be used to
promote worthless properties or projects.”</p>

<h2 class='num'>III<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Poor Boy Once Borrowed Books
Now Gives Away Libraries.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>SELFISH wealth stands surprised, amazed, almost
indignant, at the announcement that Andrew
Carnegie, instead of resting in Olympian luxury
on the millions he has earned, and going to the
grave with his gold tightly clutched in his stiffening
fingers, proposes to expend the bulk of his riches, during
his lifetime, for the benefit of his fellowmen. Great
financiers, who, if they lived to be as old as Methuselah,
could not use a tithe of their vast fortunes on their own
ordinary maintenance, protest against Mr. Carnegie’s
plan of action, and declare that he ought to go on
accumulating to the last. Others mildly suggest that
his charity will be wasted on unworthy objects, and
others frankly avow that they doubt the sincerity of
his intentions. Altogether it may be said that Mr.
Carnegie has stirred the very heart of Mammon as it
has not been stirred since the Savior told the rich man
to sell what he had and give to the poor.</p>


<h3>IT IS HARDER NOW TO GET A START.</h3>

<p>“There is no doubt,” said Mr. Carnegie, in reply to
a question from me, “that it is becoming harder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
harder, as business gravitates more and more to immense
concerns, for a young man without capital to get
a start for himself, and in large cities it is especially
so, where large capital is essential. Still it can be
honestly said that there is no other country in the world,
where able and energetic young men and women can so
readily rise as in this. A president of a business college
informed me, recently, that he has never been able
to supply the demand for capable, first-class [Mark the
adjective] bookkeepers, and his college has over nine
hundred students. In America, young men of ability
rise with most astonishing rapidity.”</p>

<p>“As quickly as when you were a boy?”</p>

<p>“Much more so. When I was a boy, there were but
very few important positions that a boy could aspire
to. Everything had to be made. Now a boy doesn’t
need to make the place,—all he has to do is to fit himself
to take it.”</p>

<p>“Did you make your high places as you went along?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t call them high, and I did not make the
earliest ones. In starting new enterprises, of course,
I made my place at the head of them. The earliest
ones were the poorest kinds of positions, however.”</p>

<p>“Where did you begin life?”</p>

<p>“In Dunfermline, Scotland. That was only my
home during my earliest years. The service of my life
has all been in this country.”</p>

<p>“In Pittsburg?”</p>

<p>“Largely so. My father settled in Allegheny City,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when I was only ten years old, and I began to earn my
way in Pittsburg.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me what your first service
was?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I was a bobbin boy in a cotton factory,
then an engine-man or boy in the same place, and later
still I was a messenger boy for a telegraph company.”</p>


<h3>MR. CARNEGIE’S FIRST WAGES.</h3>

<p>“At small wages, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“One dollar and twenty cents a week was what I received
as a bobbin boy, and I can tell you that I considered
it pretty good, at that. When I was thirteen,
I had learned to run a steam engine, and for that I received
a dollar and eighty cents a week.”</p>

<p>“You had no early schooling, then?”</p>

<p>“None, except such as I gave myself. There were
no fine libraries then, but in Allegheny City, where I
lived, there was a certain Colonel Anderson, who was
well to do and of a philanthropic turn. He announced
about the time I first began to work, that he would be
in his library at his home, every Saturday, ready to
lend books to working boys and men. He only had
about four hundred volumes, but I doubt if ever so
few books were put to better use. Only he who has
longed, as I did, for Saturday to come, that the spring
of knowledge might be opened anew to him, can understand
what Colonel Anderson did for me and others
of the boys of Allegheny. Quite a number of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have risen to eminence, and I think their rise can be
easily traced to this splendid opportunity.”</p>

<p>“How long did you remain an engine boy?”</p>

<p>“Not very long,” Mr. Carnegie replied, “perhaps a
year.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I entered a telegraph office as a messenger boy.”</p>

<p>Although Mr. Carnegie would not dwell much on
this period, he once described it at a dinner given in
honor of the American Consul at Dunfermline, Scotland,
when he said—</p>

<p>“I awake from a dream that has carried me away
back in the days of my boyhood, the day when the
little white-haired Scottish laddie, dressed in a blue
jacket, walked with his father into the telegraph office
in Pittsburg to undergo examination as an applicant
for a position as messenger boy.</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF PARADISE.</h3>

<p>“Well I remember when my uncle spoke to my
parents about it, and my father objected, because I
was then getting one dollar and eighty cents per week
for running a small engine in a cellar in Allegheny
City, but my uncle said a messenger’s wages would be
two dollars and fifty cents.... If you want an idea
as to heaven on earth, imagine what it is to be taken
from a dark cellar, where I fired the boiler from morning
until night, and dropped into an office, where light
shone from all sides, and around me books, papers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pencils in profusion, and oh! the tick of those mysterious
brass instruments on the desk, annihilating
space and standing with throbbing spirits ready to
convey any intelligence to the world! This was my
first glimpse of paradise, and I walked on air.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage to rise from this position?”</p>

<p>“Well, I learned how to operate a telegraph instrument,
and then waited my opportunity to show that I
was fit to be an operator. Eventually my chance came,
as everyone’s does.”</p>

<p>The truth is that the boy had the appearance of one
anxious to learn and quick to understand. James D.
Reid, the superintendent of the office, and himself a
Scotchman, favored the ambitious lad, and helped him.
In his “History of the Telegraph,” he says of him:—</p>

<p>“I liked the boy’s looks, and it was easy to see that,
though he was little, he was full of spirit. He had not
been with me a month when he began to ask whether
I would teach him to telegraph. I began to instruct
him and found him an apt pupil. He spent all his
spare time in practice, sending and receiving by sound
and not by tape, as was largely the custom in those
days. Pretty soon he could do as well as I could at the
key, and then his ambition carried him away beyond
doing the drudgery of messenger work.”</p>

<p>“As you look back upon it,” I said to Mr. Carnegie,
“do you consider that so lowly a beginning is better
than one a little less trying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<h3>IT IS BEST TO BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM.</h3>

<p>“For young men starting upon their lifework, it is
much the best to begin as I did, at the beginning, and
occupy the most subordinate positions. Many of the
present-day leading men of Pittsburg, who rose with
me, had a serious responsibility thrust upon them at
the very threshold of their careers. They were introduced
to the broom, and spent the first hours of their
business life sweeping out the office. I notice we have
janitors and janitresses now in offices, and our young
men, unfortunately, miss that salutary branch of early
education. Still I would say to the boy who has the
genius of the future partner in him, that if by chance
the professional sweeper is absent any morning, do not
hesitate to try your hand at the broom. It does not
hurt the newest comer to sweep out the office if necessary.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“Many’s the time. And who do you suppose were
my fellow sweepers? David McBargo, afterward
superintendent of the Allegheny Valley Railroad;
Robert Pitcairn, afterward superintendent of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, and Mr. Moreland, subsequently
City Attorney of Pittsburg. We all took turns, two
each morning doing the sweeping; and now I remember
Davie was so proud of his clean shirt bosom that
he used to spread over it an old silk bandana handkerchief
which he kept for the purpose, and we other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
boys thought he was putting on airs. So he was. None
of us had a silk handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“After you had learned to telegraph, did you consider
that you had reached high enough?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. My father died just at that time,
and the burden of the support of the family fell upon
me. I became an operator at twenty-five dollars a
month, a sum which seemed to me almost a fortune. I
earned a little additional money by copying telegraphic
messages for the newspapers, and managed to keep the
family independent.”</p>


<h3>HE WAS AN EXPERT TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.</h3>

<p>More light on this period of Mr. Carnegie’s career is
given by the “Electric Age,” which says: “He was a
telegraph operator abreast of older and experienced
men; and, although receiving messages by sound was,
at that time, forbidden by authority as being unsafe,
young Carnegie quickly acquired the art, and he can
still stand behind the ticker and understand its language.
As an operator, he delighted in full employment
and the prompt discharge of business, and a big
day’s work was his chief pleasure.”</p>

<p>“How long did you remain with the telegraph company?”</p>

<p>“Until I was given a place by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company.”</p>

<p>“As an operator?”</p>

<p>“At first, until I showed how the telegraph could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
minister to railroad safety and success. Then I was
made secretary to Thomas A. Scott, then superintendent,
and not long afterward, when Colonel Scott became
vice-president, I was made superintendent of the
western division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.”</p>

<p>Thinking of this period of his life, I asked Mr. Carnegie
if his promotion was not a matter of chance, and
whether he did not, at the time, feel it to be so. His
answer was emphatic.</p>

<p>“Never. Young men give all kinds of reasons why,
in their cases, failure is attributable to exceptional circumstances,
which rendered success impossible. Some
never had a chance, according to their own story. This
is simply nonsense. No young man ever lived who
had not a chance, and a splendid chance, too, if he was
ever employed at all. He is assayed in the mind of his
immediate superior, from the day he begins work, and,
after a time, if he has merit, he is assayed in the council
chambers of the firm. His ability, honesty, habits, associations,
temper, disposition—all these are weighed and
analyzed. The young man who never had a chance is
the same young man who has been canvassed over and
over again by his superiors, and found destitute of
necessary qualifications, or is deemed unworthy of
closer relations with the firm, owing to some objectionable
act, habit or association, of which he thought
his employers ignorant.”</p>

<p>“It sounds true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE RIGHT MEN IN DEMAND.</h3>

<p>“It is. Another class of young men attribute failure
to rise to employers having near relatives or favorites
whom they advance unfairly. They also insist that
their employers dislike brighter intelligence than their
own, and are disposed to discourage aspiring genius,
and delighted in keeping young men down. There is
nothing in this. On the contrary, there is no one suffering
more for lack of the right man in the right place
than the average employer, nor anyone more anxious to
find him.”</p>

<p>“Was this your theory on the subject when you began
working for the railroad company?”</p>

<p>“I had no theory then, although I have formulated
one since. It lies mainly in this: Instead of the question,
‘What must I do for my employer?’ substitute,
‘What can I do?’ Faithful and conscientious discharge
of duties assigned you is all very well, but the verdict
in such cases generally is that you perform your present
duties so well, that you would better continue performing
them. Now, this will not do. It will not do for
the coming partners. There must be something beyond
this. We make clerks, bookkeepers, treasurers,
bank tellers of this class, and there they remain to the
end of the chapter. The rising man must do something
exceptional, and beyond the range of his special department.
He must attract attention.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOW TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.</h3>

<p>“How can he do that?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he is a shipping clerk, he may do so by discovering
in an invoice an error with which he has nothing
to do and which has escaped the attention of the
proper party. If a weighing clerk, he may save the
firm by doubting the adjustment of the scales, and having
them corrected, even if this be the province of the
master mechanic. If a messenger boy, he can lay the
seed of promotion by going beyond the letter of his
instructions in order to secure the desired reply. There
is no service so low and simple, neither any so high, in
which the young man of ability and willing disposition
cannot readily and almost daily prove himself capable
of greater trust and usefulness, and, what is equally
important, show his invincible determination to rise.”</p>

<p>“In what manner did you reach out to establish your
present great fortune?” I asked.</p>

<p>“By saving my money. I put a little money aside,
and it served me later as a matter of credit. Also, I
invested in a sleeping-car industry, which paid me
well.”</p>


<h3>CARNEGIE AND THE SLEEPING-CAR.</h3>

<p>Although I tried earnestly to get the great iron-king
to talk of this, he said little, because the matter has been
fully dealt with by him in his “Triumphant Democracy.”
From his own story there, it appears that, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
day at this time, when Mr. Carnegie still had his fortune
to make, he was on a train examining the line from
a rear window of a car, when a tall, spare man, accosted
him and asked him to look at an invention he had made.
He drew from a green bag a small model of a sleeping-berth
for railway cars, and proceeded to point out its
advantages. It was Mr. T. T. Woodruff, the inventor
of the sleeping-car. Mr. Carnegie tells the story himself
in “Triumphant Democracy:”—</p>

<p>“He had not spoken a moment, before, like a flash,
the whole range of the discovery burst upon me. ‘Yes,’
I said, ‘that is something which this continent must
have.’</p>

<p>“Upon my return, I laid it before Mr. Scott, declaring
that it was one of the inventions of the age. He remarked:
‘You are enthusiastic, young man, but you
may ask the inventor to come and let me see it.’ I did
so, and arrangements were made to build two trial cars,
and run them on the Pennsylvania Railroad. I was
offered an interest in the venture, which, of course, I
gladly accepted.</p>

<p>“The notice came that my share of the first payment
was $217.50. How well I remember the exact sum!
But two hundred and seventeen dollars and a half were
as far beyond my means as if it had been millions. I
was earning fifty dollars per month, however, and had
prospects, or at least I always felt that I had. I decided
to call on the local banker and boldly ask him to advance
the sum upon my interest in the affair. He put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his hand on my shoulder and said: ‘Why, of course,
Andie; you are all right. Go ahead! Here is the
money.’</p>

<p>“It is a proud day for a man when he pays his last
note, but not to be named in comparison with the day
in which he makes his first one, and gets a banker to
take it. I have tried both, and I know. The cars paid
the subsequent payments from their earnings. I paid
my first note from my savings, so much per month, and
thus did I get my foot upon fortune’s ladder. It was
easy to climb after that.”</p>

<p>“I would like some expression from you,” I said to
Mr. Carnegie, “in reference to the importance of laying
aside money from one’s earnings, as a young man.”</p>


<h3>THE MARK OF A MILLIONAIRE.</h3>

<p>“You can have it. There is one sure mark of the
coming partner, the future millionaire; his revenues
always exceed his expenditures. He begins to save
early, almost as soon as he begins to earn. I should
say to young men, no matter how little it may be possible
to save, save that little. Invest it securely, not
necessarily in bonds, but in anything which you have
good reason to believe will be profitable; but no gambling
with it, remember. A rare chance will soon present
itself for investment. The little you have saved
will prove the basis for an amount of credit utterly surprising
to you. Capitalists trust the saving young man:
For, every hundred dollars you can produce as the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of hard-won savings, Midas, in search of a partner,
will lend or credit a thousand; for every thousand, fifty
thousand. It is not capital that your seniors require,
it is the man who has proved that he has the business
habits which create capital. So it is the first hundred
dollars saved that tells.”</p>

<p>“What,” I asked Mr. Carnegie, “was the next enterprise
with which you identified yourself?”</p>


<h3>A FORTUNATE LAND PURCHASE.</h3>

<p>“In company with several others, I purchased the
now famous Storey farm, on Oil Creek, Pennsylvania,
where a well had been bored and natural oil struck the
year before. This proved a very profitable investment.”</p>

<p>“Were you satisfied to rest with these enterprises in
your hands?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No; railway bridges were then built almost exclusively
of wood, but the Pennsylvania Railroad had
begun to experiment with cast iron for bridge building.
It struck me that the railway bridge of the future must
be of iron, and I organized, in Pittsburg, a company
for the construction of iron bridges. That was the
Keystone Bridge Works. We built the first iron bridge
across the Ohio.”</p>

<p>His entrance to the realm of steel was much too long
for Mr. Carnegie to discuss, although he was not unwilling
to give information relating to the great subject.
It appears that he realized the immensity of the
steel manufacturing business at once. The Union Iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Mills soon followed as one of his enterprises, and, later
the famous Edgar Thompson Steel Rail Mill. The last
was the outcome of a visit to England, in 1868, when
Carnegie noticed that English railways were discarding
iron for steel rails. The Bessemer process had been
then perfected, and was making its way in all the iron-producing
countries. Carnegie, recognizing that it was
destined to revolutionize the iron business, introduced
it into his mills and made steel rails with which he was
enabled to compete with English manufacturers.</p>


<h3>THE HOMESTEAD STEEL WORKS.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/illus01.jpg" width="323" height="500" alt="Mother by cradle" />
<div class="caption">INFANCY</div>
</div>
<p>His next enterprise was the purchase of the Homestead
Steel Works,—his great rival of Pittsburg. By
1888, he had built or acquired seven distinct iron and
steel works. All the plants of this great firm are within
a radius of five miles of Pittsburg. In no other part of
the world can be found such an aggregation of splendidly
equipped steel works as those controlled by Carnegie
and his associates. It now comprises the Homestead
Steel Works, the Edgar Thompson Steel Works
and Furnaces, the Duquesne Steel Works and Furnaces,
all within two miles of one another; the Lucy
Furnaces, the Keystone Bridge Works, the Upper
Union Rolling Mills, and the Lower Union Rolling
Mills.</p>


<p>In all branches, including the great coke works,
mines, etc., there are employed twenty-five thousand
men. The monthly pay roll exceeds one million, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, or nearly
fifty thousand dollars for each working day.</p>

<p>“You believe in taking active measures,” I said, “to
make men successful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe in anything which will help men to
help themselves. To induce them to save, every workman,
in our company, is allowed to deposit part of his
earnings, not exceeding two thousand dollars, with the
firm, on which the high interest rate of six per cent. is
allowed. The firm also lends to any of its workmen to
buy a lot, or to build a house, taking its pay by installments.”</p>

<p>“Has this contributed any to the success of your company?”</p>


<h3>A STRENGTHENING POLICY.</h3>

<p>“I think so. The policy of giving a personal interest
to the men who render exceptional service is strengthening.
With us there are many such, and every year
several more are added as partners. It is the policy of
the concern to interest every superintendent in the
works, every head of a department, every exceptional
young man. Promotion follows exceptional service,
and there is no favoritism.”</p>

<p>“All you have said so far merely gives the idea of
getting money, without any suggestion as to the proper
use of great wealth. Will you say something on that
score?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“My views are rather well known, I think. What a
man owns is already subordinate, in America, to what
he knows; but, in the final aristocracy, the question
will not be either of these, but what has he done for his
fellows? Where has he shown generosity and self-abnegation?
Where has he been a father to the fatherless?
And the cause of the poor; where has he searched
that out? How he has worshipped God will not be
asked in that day, but how he has served man.”</p>


<h3>MR. CARNEGIE’S PHILANTHROPY.</h3>

<p>That Mr. Carnegie has lived up, in the past, and is
still living up to this radical declaration of independence
from the practice of men who have amassed fortunes
around him, will be best shown by a brief enumeration
of some of his almost unexampled philanthropies.
His largest gift has been to the city of Pittsburg,
the scene of his early trials and later triumphs. There
he has built, at a cost of more than a million dollars, a
magnificent library, museum, concert hall and picture
gallery, all under one roof, and endowed it with a fund
of another million, the interest of which (fifty thousand
dollars per annum), is being devoted to the purchase
of the best works of American art. Other libraries, to
be connected with this largest as a center, are now being
constructed, which will make the city of Pittsburg and
its environs a beneficiary of his generosity to the extent
of five million dollars.</p>

<p>In his native land, Scotland, thrift is a virtue that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
taught with the alphabet; and, when the twelve-year-old
“Andy” Carnegie came to America with his father
and mother, he was full of the notion of thrift and its
twin brother, hard work.</p>


<h3>CARNEGIE’S VIEWS ON THRIFT.</h3>

<p>Once he wrote on the subject of thrift for a Scottish
journal. He said:—</p>

<p>“The accumulation of millions is usually the result
of enterprise and judgment, and some exceptional ability
or organization. It does not come from savings, in
the ordinary sense of the word. Men who, in old age,
strive only to increase their already too great hoards,
are usually slaves of the habit of hoarding, formed in
their youth. At first they own the money they have
made and saved. Later in life the money owns them,
and they cannot help themselves, so overpowering is
the force of habit, either for good or evil. It is the
abuse of the civilized saving instinct, and not its use,
that produces this class of men. No one needs to be
afraid of falling a victim to this abuse of the habit, if
he always bears in mind that whatever surplus wealth
may come to him is to be regarded as a sacred trust,
which he is bound to administer for the good of his fellows.
The man should always be master. He should
keep money in the position of a useful servant; he
must never let it be his master and make a miser of
him. A man’s first duty is to acquire a competence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
be independent, then to do something for his needy
neighbors who are less favored than himself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carnegie has always lived up to this doctrine.
He has made philanthropy a factor of existence.
Already he has endowed over ninety libraries in different
cities of the United States, having spent about
$4,500,000 in this manner alone. He believes that a
man can learn the science of true life and success in
good books. In Scotland, where many of the residents
of a poor hamlet have been benefited by his generosity,
he is called “the good angel.” Whenever he visits any
of these places, he is a greater man than the King of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>While thus endowing the city where his fortune was
made, he has not forgotten other places endeared to
him by association or by interest. To the Allegheny
Free Library he has given $375,000; to the Braddock
Free Library, $250,000; to the Johnstown Free Library,
$50,000, and to the Fairfield (Iowa) Library, $40,000.
To his native land he has been scarcely less generous.
To the Edinburgh Free Library he has given $250,000,
and to his native town of Dunfermline, $90,000. Other
Scottish towns to the number of ten have received
helpful donations of amounts not quite so large.</p>

<p>“I should like you to say some other important things
for the young man to learn and benefit by.”</p>

<p>“Our young partners in the Carnegie company have
all won their spurs by showing that we did not know
half as well what was wanted as they did. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them have acted upon occasions with me as if they
owned the firm and I was but some airy New Yorker,
presuming to advise upon what I knew very little about.
Well, they are not now interfered with. They were the
true bosses,—the very men we were looking for.”</p>


<h3>“THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING RICH MEN’S SONS.”</h3>

<p>“Is this all for the poor boy?”</p>

<p>“Every word. I trust that few, if any, of your
readers have the misfortune to be rich men’s sons.
They are heavily weighted in the race. A basketful of
bonds is the heaviest basket a young man ever had to
carry. He generally gets to staggering under it. The
vast majority of rich men’s sons are unable to resist the
temptations to which wealth subjects them, and they
sink to unworthy lives. It is not from this class that
the poor beginner has rivalry to fear. The partner’s
sons will never trouble you much, but look out that
some boys poorer, much poorer, than yourselves, whose
parents cannot afford to give them any schooling, do
not challenge you at the post and pass you at the grand
stand. Look out for the boy who has to plunge into
work direct from the common school, and begins by
sweeping out the office. He is the probable dark horse
that will take all the money and win all the applause.</p>

<p>“The first thing that a man should learn to do is to
save his money. By saving his money he promotes
thrift,—the most valued of all habits. Thrift is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
great fortune-maker. It draws the line between the
savage and the civilized man. Thrift not only develops
the fortune, but it develops, also, the man’s character.”</p>

<span class="chaptertitle">A Good Shoemaker Becomes Detroit’s
Best Mayor and Michigan’s
Greatest Governor.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>AN interview with Hon. Hazen S. Pingree, Governor
of Michigan, was not an easy thing to
obtain. “Approachable?” Very. He was a
great favorite with newspaper men, but the
most-sought-after man in Michigan. When he arrived
at the simply furnished room that served as his
official headquarters in Detroit, it was to find it bordered
with a human wainscoting, each anxious member
of which was waiting patiently, or otherwise, to
ask some favor of the chief executive. As he entered
the room suddenly became quiet; for there was something
about the Governor’s powerful personality that
compelled attention. But soon each want, no matter
how small, was attended to in his kindly but straight-forward
way.</p>

<p>An interesting medley of petitioners was present
on the day of my interview. The first was a widowed
mother requesting a favor for her son—a wreck of
the Spanish-American war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll do the best I can for you,” said the governor
heartily as she left the room—and everyone knew
what that meant.</p>

<p>Next came a gayly-dressed young woman, with a
bill from the mint of her own imagination, which she
asked the Governor to please push through the legislature.
She was patiently referred to the representative
from her district. Then a soldier stood before
him with a transportation snarl to untangle; a book
agent; a broadcloth-coated dandy, and a street laborer,
each seeking help; and then a gaunt, ill-clad
old woman, who in broken English, with harrowing
tears and gestures of despair, laid her humble burdens
in supplication before him. It was a touching
picture.</p>

<p>Hers was not a case to lay before the Governor of
the State, but she will never know it, poor woman, for
the generous hand of the great-hearted man slid
quickly down to the nest of the golden eagle that sent
her gratefully away.</p>

<p>“You are not a native of the State you govern,”
said I, as the Governor leisurely seated himself for
the interview.</p>

<p>“No; I was born in Denmark, Maine. My father
owned a forty-acre farm, and I was brought up there
until I was about seventeen years old.”</p>

<p>“And you did——”</p>

<p>“Just what any one would do on a small farm;
worked in summer and went to school in the winter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Then I started out to make my own way in the world,
and the first work I found was in a cotton mill at
Saco, Maine. In 1860, I went to Hopkinton, Massachusetts,
and learned the trade of a cutter in a shoe
factory. Soon after that the war broke out.”</p>

<p>“And you enlisted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have two honorable discharges as a private.
I value them more than my position as governor.”</p>

<p>“How long were you in the war?”</p>

<p>“From 1862 until its close. I first enlisted in Company
F, First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, and,
with that regiment, took part in the battles of Bull
Run, Fredericksburg Road, Harris Farm, Cold Harbor,
Spottsylvania Court House, North Anna and
South Anna.”</p>

<p>“Then you know something of the horrors of war
from your own experience?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is the reason I am an advocate of the
universal peace project.”</p>

<p>“You believe in that?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly; and, moreover, I believe that ten years
from now every man who calls himself a Christian
will be ready to stand by the side of the Emperor of
Russia in his plea for peace.”</p>

<p>“Let us return to your experience in the war.
Were you ever a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“Several others and myself were captured on May
25, 1864, by a squad of Mosby’s men. We were confined
five months at Andersonville; and from there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
were taken to Salisbury prison in North Carolina,
then to Millen, Georgia, where we were exchanged
in November, 1864. I rejoined my regiment in front
of Petersburg, and was in the expedition to Weldon
Railroad, the battles of Boynton Road, Petersburg,
Sailors’ Creek, Farmsville, and Appomattox.”</p>

<p>“And after the war?”</p>

<p>“I came to Detroit and obtained employment in a
shoe factory. Soon after that my partner and myself
started one of our own. He had a little less than a
thousand dollars, and I had $460—left from my army
pay.”</p>

<p>“That seemed a large sum, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I thought if I could ever get to making
fifty pairs of shoes a day I would be perfectly
happy.”</p>

<p>The number is amusingly small, when it is remembered
that this factory, the embryo of which he spoke,
grew up under the Governor’s personal supervision,
until it is now one of the largest in the United States.</p>

<p>“But tell me, Governor, when you were starting
out in life, did you ever look forward to the career
you have carved out for yourself?”</p>

<p>“No,” said he, with the promptness that characterizes
all of his speech; “I never had anything mapped
out in my life. I did whatever there happened to be
for me to do, and let the result take care of itself.”</p>

<p>“Is it the same with your political success, or is
that the outgrowth of youthful ambition?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<h3>HOW HE BECAME MAYOR OF DETROIT.</h3>

<p>“No, I was pushed into that by accident. I had
never been in the common council chamber before I
was elected Mayor of Detroit. The thing that caught
me was that my friends began to say I was afraid of
the position, so, of course, I had to accept the nomination
to prove that I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>This was clever of his friends. The fact is that,
at that time, the city needed the Governor’s brains to
manage its affairs. He was elected Mayor of Detroit
four consecutive terms and was in his eighth year as
mayor when he resigned. Even his most earnest
political opponents admit that he was the best mayor
the city ever had.</p>

<p>“But, during the formative years of your career,
did you ever worry over the possibility of failure?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Governor serenely, “I never did,
and don’t now. I was never given to worrying.”</p>

<p>In this as in other ways, Mr. Pingree was remarkable.
During the stormiest of his political times he
was never in the least disturbed when he reached
home, and he would sleep as peacefully as a child.</p>

<p>“What would you suggest, Governor, as the best
route by which the young man of to-day may obtain
success?”</p>

<p>“He can do one of two things: go to work for
somebody else; or, if he cannot stand that, he can buy
a small farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you think there is not the chance in the
United States now that there was thirty years ago?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a doubt about it. The young men of
to-day are to be pitied—there isn’t anything for them
to do. The subject is a serious one,” said the Governor,
speaking rapidly. “Why, if I had nothing, I
wouldn’t know how to advise my own son to start.
I don’t claim to know much, but I do understand a
little about the shoe business, and I can tell you
honestly that, with the knowledge I have gained in
many years of experience, and with the influence of
my friends, I could not start in the shoe business to-day
with the chance of success that I had then.”</p>

<p>“And the causes of this?”</p>

<p>“Are trusts and monopolies.”</p>

<p>“And the result?”</p>


<h3>A GREAT CHANGE PROPHESIED.</h3>

<p>“There will be a great change in this country before
many years. Free schools have so educated the
people that they will not submit to this injustice forever,
even though it is organized against them.”</p>

<p>“But how will this change be effected?”</p>

<p>“Through the splitting up of political parties—but
it is sure to come.”</p>

<p>“Recognizing the conditions that the young man
of to-day has to contend with, what guide-posts
would you point out to him?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, I would advise every young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to be honest and outspoken at all times. What people
want is open, frank talk. There is too much catering
and palavering and round-about talking nowadays.
It is a great mistake. Then, of course, in order to
accomplish anything, the young man must have
plenty of energy and perseverance.”</p>

<p>By inheritance, Governor Pingree was a patriot
and fighter. In his possession were three historic
muskets, one of which was used by his great-grandfather
in the Revolutionary War; another by his
grandfather in the War of 1812, and one by himself
in the Civil War. His first American forefather was
Moses Pingree, who emigrated to this country in
1640. Many of his descendants have figured with distinction
in American history, among them being
Samuel Everett Pingree, Governor of Vermont from
1884 to 1886.</p>

<p>Governor Pingree was a strikingly interesting example
of self-earned success. His indomitable will,
tireless energy and unyielding perseverance were the
machinery with which he manufactured the fabric of
his career. But the pattern was stamped by his own
individuality, and was like no other ever seen—it was
<i>sui generis</i>.</p>

<p>On the battlefield of public life, Governor Pingree
was a general who said, “Come on!” not “Go on!”
He acted with the bold, unfettered authority that
springs from an honest belief in the justice of his
opinions, and never put his plans out of focus by shifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his ground. When once resolved, he was as immovable
as a fixed star. He was absolutely fearless because
he was absolutely honest, and was not afraid to
fight, single-handed, the greatest financial power the
world has ever known.</p>

<p>The political spider was never able to bind his arms
with the thread of party combination—scheme or intrigue.
He was at all times a free lance, fearless and
ceaseless in his efforts to chip the veneer from gilded
fraud, to pierce the heart of injustice and to befriend
those not able to shield themselves. He was a champion
of the people and a believer in them.</p>


<h3>HE WAS NOT A DEMAGOGUE.</h3>

<p>“But they call you a demagogue. How does that
accusation affect you?”</p>

<p>The Governor smiled, as if he considered it a good
joke.</p>

<p>“Well, that amuses me,” said he. “They don’t do
that around here any more. They’ve worn it out, I
guess. No, it doesn’t disturb me a particle. I always
go on the principle that lies never hurt anybody.”</p>

<p>Governor Pingree was a man of powerful physique
and dignity of bearing. But he was delightfully oblivious
to his own importance, and was entirely devoid
of ostentation in everything that he did or said. His
disposition was buoyant, his manner that of frank simplicity,
and he was prodigal in his generosity and
sympathy for those in need. In his private business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the welfare of his employees was always balanced in
the scale with his own.</p>

<p>In the camps of war he was known as “Father Pingree,”
and when the boys returned to Detroit he was
the first to greet them. But no one ever saw him in
an open carriage behind the band; he was always
away off in a corner of the station, where the ambulances
were waiting, giving a word of encouragement
to this poor fellow and patting that one on the back.
He worked for forty hours at a time, without a
thought of sleep, to keep up a cheerful welcome,
though many a time he was seen to turn away just
long enough to brush the tears from his eyes.</p>


<h3>GOVERNOR PINGREE’S LUXURIOUS HOME.</h3>

<p>The home life of Governor Pingree was as beautiful
as his life in public was successful. His residence, a
three-story gray stone house, was a model of quiet
elegance and refinement, and there his greatest happiness
was found.</p>

<p>The accusation was often made that the people
of Michigan did not appreciate the Governor. However,
during his last election, he was not a prophet
without honor in his own country, for the long-continued
climbing up of his majority caused one of the
local newspapers to suggest that the State set aside
special holidays to satisfy the appetite for voting for
Pingree.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Determined not to Remain Poor,
a Farmer Boy Becomes a Merchant
Prince</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MARSHALL FIELD, one of the greatest merchants
of the United States, and that means
of the world, is not readily accessible to interviewers.
He probably feels, like most men
of real prominence, that his place in the history of his
time is established, and he is not seeking for the fame
that is certain to attend his name and his business
achievements. No more significant story, none more
full of stimulus, of encouragement, of brain-inspiring
and pulse-thrilling potency has been told in any romance.
It is grand in its very simplicity, in its very lack
of assumption of special gifts or extraordinary foresight.
The Phœnix-like revival from the ashes of ruined
Chicago is spoken of by Mr. Field as an incident in the
natural and to be expected in the order of events. In
Marshall Field it was no doubt natural and to be expected,
and it touches the very keynote of the character
of the celebrated western merchant, sprung from
rugged eastern soil, whose career is an example to be
studied with profit by every farmer boy, by every office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
boy, by every clerk and artisan,—yes, and by every
middle-aged business man, whether going along
smoothly or confronted by apparently ruinous circumstances,
throughout our broad land.</p>

<p>I was introduced to Mr. Field in the private office of
Mr. Harry G. Selfridge, his most trusted lieutenant,
and this first of interviews with the head of Chicago’s
greatest mercantile house followed.</p>

<p>“My object,” I said to Mr. Field, “is to obtain your
opinion as to what makes for and constitutes success in
life.”</p>

<p>“That can be quickly given,” said Mr. Field; “what
would you like to know?”</p>

<p>“I wish to know something of your early life, and
under what conditions you began it.”</p>

<p>“I was born in Conway, Massachusetts, in 1835. My
father’s farm was among the rocks and hills of that section,
and not very fertile.”</p>

<p>“And the conditions were?”</p>

<p>“Hard.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you were poor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as all people were in those days, more or less.
My father was a farmer. I was brought up under
farming conditions, such as they were at that time.”</p>


<h3>HIS PARENTS HELPED HIM.</h3>

<p>“Did the character and condition of your parents
tend in any way to form your ambition for commercial
distinction?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, somewhat. My father was a man who, I consider,
had good judgment. He made a success out of
the farming business. My mother was more intellectually
bent, if anything, and, naturally, both my parents
were anxious that their boys should amount to something
in life. Their interest and care helped me.”</p>

<p>“Had you early access to books?”</p>

<p>“No; I had but few books, scarcely any to speak of.
There was not much time for literature. Such books
as we had, though, I made use of.”</p>

<p>“Were you so placed that your commercial instincts
could be nourished by contact with that side of life?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, in a measure. Not any more so than any other
boy raised in that neighborhood. I had a leaning toward
business, and took up with it as early as possible.”</p>

<p>“Were you naturally of a saving disposition?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I had to be. Those were saving times. A
dollar looked very big to us boys in those days, and as
we had difficult labor earning it, it was not quickly
spent. I may say I was naturally saving, however, and
was determined not to remain poor.”</p>

<p>“Did you attend both school and college?”</p>

<p>“Only the common and high schools at home, but not
for long. I had no college training. Indeed, I cannot
say that I had much of any public school education. I
left home when I was seventeen years of age, and, of
course, had not time to study closely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was the nature of your first venture in trade,
Mr. Field?”</p>

<p>“My first venture was made as a clerk in a country
store at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where all things were
sold, including dry goods, and there I remained for four
years. There I picked up my first knowledge of that
business.”</p>

<p>“Do you consider those years well spent?”</p>

<p>“I think my employer did, anyway.” He laughed.</p>

<p>“I saved my earnings and attended strictly to business,
and so made them valuable years to me.”</p>

<p>“Was there no inducement to remain there as you
were?”</p>

<p>“Yes; before I went west, my employer offered me a
quarter interest in his business if I would remain with
him. Even after I had been here several years, he
wrote and offered me a third interest if I would go
back. But I was already too well placed.”</p>

<p>“Did you fancy that you were destined for some other
field than that in which you have since distinguished
yourself?”</p>


<h3>ALWAYS INTERESTED IN COMMERCE.</h3>

<p>“No, I think not. I was always interested in the
commercial side of life, and always thought I would be
a merchant. To this end, I bent my energies, and soon
realized that, successful or not, my labor would always
be of a commercial nature.”</p>

<p>“When did you come to Chicago?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I caught what was then the prevalent fever to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
west, and grow up with the country, and west I came.
I entered as a clerk in the dry goods house of Cooley,
Woodsworth &amp; Co., in South Water street.”</p>

<p>“Did you foresee Chicago’s growth in any way?”</p>

<p>“No, there was no guarantee at that time that the
place would ever become the western metropolis. The
town had plenty of ambition and pluck; but the possibilities
of greatness were hardly visible.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection that the
story of Mr. Field’s progress is a wonderfully close
index of Chicago’s marvelous growth. An almost exact
parallel may be drawn between the career of the individual
and the growth of the town. Chicago was organized
in 1837, two years after Mr. Field was born on
the far-off farm in New England, and the place then
had a population of a little more than four thousand.
In 1856, when Mr. Field, fully equipped for a successful
mercantile career, became a resident of the future
metropolis of the west, the population had grown to
little more than eighty-four thousand. Mr. Field’s
prosperity advanced in strides parallel to those of the
city; with Chicago he was stricken but not crushed by
the great fire of 1871, and with Chicago he advanced
again to higher achievement and far greater prosperity
than before the calamity.</p>

<p>“What were your equipments for success when you
started as a clerk here in Chicago, in 1856?”</p>

<p>“Health, sound principles, I hope, and ambition,”
answered Mr. Field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“And brains,” I suggested; but he only smiled.</p>

<p>“What were the conditions here?”</p>

<p>“Well, merit did not have to wait for dead men’s
shoes in a growing town, of course. Good qualities
were usually promptly discovered, and men were pushed
forward rapidly.”</p>

<p>“How long did you remain a clerk?”</p>

<p>“Only four years. In 1860, I was made a partner,
and in 1865, there was a partial reorganization, and the
firm consisted after that of Mr. Leiter, Mr. Palmer and
myself (Field, Palmer &amp; Leiter). Two years later Mr.
Palmer withdrew, and until 1881 the style of the firm
was Field, Leiter &amp; Co. Mr. Leiter retired in that year,
and since then it has been as at present: (Marshall
Field &amp; Co.)</p>

<p>“What contributed most to the great growth of your
business?” I asked.</p>

<p>“To answer that question,” said Mr. Field, “would
be to review the condition of the west from the time
Chicago began until the fire in 1871. Everything was
coming this way: immigration, railways and water traffic,
and Chicago was enjoying what was called ‘flush
times.’ There were things to learn about the country,
and the man who learned the quickest fared the best.
For instance, the comparative newness of rural communities
and settlements made a knowledge of local
solvency impossible. The old state banking system
prevailed, and speculation of every kind was rampant.
The panic of 1857 swept almost everything away except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the house I worked for, and I learned that the reason
they survived was because they understood the nature
of the new country, and did a cash business. That is,
they bought for cash, and sold on thirty and sixty days,
instead of giving the customers, whose financial condition
you could hardly tell anything about, all the time
they wanted. When the panic came, they had no debts,
and little owing to them, and so they weathered it all
right. I learned what I consider my best lesson, and
that was to do a cash business.”</p>


<h3>HIS PRINCIPLES OF BUSINESS.</h3>

<p>“What were some of the principles you applied to
your business?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Well, I made it a point that all goods should be
exactly what they were represented to be. It was a
rule of the house that an exact scrutiny of the quality
of all goods purchased should be maintained, and that
nothing was to induce the house to place upon the market
any line of goods at a shade of variation from their
real value. Every article sold must be regarded as warranted,
and every purchaser must be enabled to feel
secure.”</p>

<p>“Did you suffer any losses or reverses during your
career?”</p>

<p>“No loss except by the fire of 1871. It swept away
everything,—about three and a half millions. We
were, of course, protected by insurance, which would
have been sufficient against any ordinary calamity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the kind. But the disaster was so sweeping that some
of the companies which had insured our property were
blotted out, and a long time passed before our claims
against others were settled. We managed, however, to
start again. There were no buildings of brick or stone
left standing, but there were some great shells of horse-car
barns at State and Twentieth streets which were not
burned, and I hired those. We put up signs announcing
that we would continue business uninterruptedly,
and then rushed the work of fitting things up and getting
in the stock.”</p>

<p>“Did the panic of 1873 effect your business?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. We didn’t have any debts.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what you consider to have been the turning-point
in your career,—the point after which there
was no more danger of poverty?”</p>

<p>“Saving the first five thousand dollars I ever had,
when I might just as well have spent the moderate salary
I made. Possession of that sum, once I had it, gave
me the ability to meet opportunities. That I consider
the turning-point.”</p>


<h3>PERSEVERANCE, MR. FIELD’S ESSENTIAL TRAIT.</h3>

<p>“What one trait of your character do you look upon
as having been the most essential to your successful
career?”</p>

<p>“Perseverance,” said Mr. Field; but another at hand
insisted upon the addition of “good judgment” to this,
which Mr. Field indifferently acknowledged. “If I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
compelled to lay claim to these traits,” he went on, “it
is simply because I have tried to practice them, and because
the trying has availed me much, I suppose. I
have always tried to make all my acts and commercial
moves the result of definite consideration and sound
judgment. There were never any great ventures or
risks,—nothing exciting whatever. I simply practiced
honest, slow-growing business methods, and tried to
back them with energy and good system.”</p>

<p>“Have you always been a hard-worker?”</p>

<p>“No,” Mr. Field said, with the shadow of a smile.
“I have never believed in overworking, either as applied
to myself or others. It is always paid for with a short
life, and I do not believe in it.”</p>

<p>“Has there ever been a time in your life when you
gave as much as eighteen hours a day to your work?”</p>

<p>“Never. That is, never as a steady practice. During
the time of the fire in 1871, there was a short period in
which I worked very hard. For several weeks then I
worked the greater part of night and day, as almost
anyone would have done in my place. My fortune,
however, has not been made in that manner, and, as I
have said, I believe in reasonable hours for everyone,
but close attention during those hours.”</p>

<p>“Do you work as much as you once did?”</p>

<p>“I never worked very many hours a day. Besides,
people do not work as many hours a day now as they
once did. The day’s labor has shortened in the last
twenty years for everyone. Still, granting that, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
cannot say that I work as much as I once did, and I
frankly admit that I do not feel the need of it.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe,” I went on, “that a man should
cease laboring before his period of usefulness is over,
so that he may enjoy some of the results of his labor
before death, or do you believe in retaining constant
interest in affairs while strength lasts?”</p>

<p>“As to that, I hold the French idea, that a man ought
to retire when he has gained a competence wherewith
to do so. I think that is a very good idea. But I do
not believe that when a man retires, or no longer attends
to his private business in person every day, he has
given up interest in the affairs of the world. He may
be, in fact should be, doing wider and greater work
when he has abandoned his private business, so far as
personal attention is concerned.”</p>


<h3>QUALITIES THAT MAKE FOR SUCCESS.</h3>

<p>“What, Mr. Field,” I said, “do you consider to be the
first requisite for success in life, so far as the young
beginner is concerned?”</p>

<p>“The qualities of honesty, energy, frugality, integrity,
are more necessary than ever to-day, and there is
no success without them. They are so often urged that
they have become commonplace, but they are really
more prized than ever.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know what you believe should be
the aim of the young man of to-day?”</p>

<p>“He should aim,” said Mr. Field, “to possess the
qualities I have mentioned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“By some, however,” I suggested, “these are looked
upon as a means to an aim only. Would you say to the
young man, ‘get wealth?’”</p>

<p>“Not,” Mr. Field answered, “without practicing unflinchingly
these virtues.”</p>

<p>“Would you say to him, ‘acquire distinction?’”</p>

<p>“Not at any expense to his moral character. I can
only say, ‘practice these virtues and do the best you
can.’ Any good fortune that comes by such methods
is deserved and admirable.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe a college education for the young
man to be a necessity in the future?”</p>

<p>“Not for business purposes. Better training will
become more and more a necessity. The truth is, with
most young men, a college education means that just
at the time when they should be having business principles
instilled into them, and be getting themselves
energetically pulled together for their life’s work, they
are sent to college. Then intervenes what many a
young man looks back on as the jolliest time of his life,—four
years of college. Often when he comes out of
college the young man is unfitted by this good time to
buckle down to hard work, and the result is a failure to
grasp opportunities that would have opened the way
for a successful career.”</p>

<p>“Would you say that happiness consists in labor, or
in contemplation of labor well done, or in increased
possibility of doing more labor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say,” said Mr. Field, “that a man finds happiness
in all three. There certainly is no pleasure in
idleness. I believe, as I have said, that a man, upon
giving up business, does not necessarily cease laboring,
but really does, or should do, more in a larger sense.
He should interest himself in public affairs. There is
no happiness in mere dollars. After they are had one
cannot use but a moderate amount of them. It is given
a man to eat so much, to wear so much, and to have so
much shelter, and more he cannot use. When money
has supplied these, its mission, so far as the individual
is concerned, is fulfilled, and man must look further
and higher. It is only in the wider public affairs,
where money is a moving force toward the general welfare,
that the possessor of it can possibly find pleasure,
and that only in doing constantly more.”</p>

<p>“What,” I said, “in your estimation, is the greatest
good a man can do?”</p>

<p>“The greatest good he can do is to cultivate himself
in order that he may be of greater use to humanity.”</p>

<p>“What one suggestion,” I said, in conclusion, “can
you give to the young men of to-day, that will be most
useful to them, if observed?”</p>

<p>“Regardless,” said Mr. Field, “of any opinion of
mine, or any wish on the part of the young men for
wealth, distinction or praise, we know that to be honest
is best. There is nothing better, and we also know that
nothing can be more helpful than this when combined
with other essential qualities.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Honesty, the Foundation of a Great
Merchant’s Career</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE men who manipulate the levers that move
the world, with few exceptions, were once poor
boys. One of the largest retail stores in the
world, in Philadelphia, and one of the handsomest
stores in America, in New York, are monuments
of the genius, industry and integrity of a “boy
with no chance” who has become the peer of any of the
merchant kings of our century. He is also one of the
very foremost in many other enterprises.</p>

<p>To accomplish all these various things, it would be
supposed that Mr. Wanamaker must have been a pet of
fortune from the first. But that is not so. He began
with nothing, as money goes, and has pushed his way
to the top by sheer force of character, and by unwearying
work.</p>

<p>I know of no career in this country that offers more
encouragement to young people. It shows what persistency
can do; it shows what intelligent, well-directed,
tireless effort can do; and it proves that a man may
devote himself to helping others, to the Sunday school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to the church, to broad philanthropy, and still be wonderfully
successful in a business way.</p>


<h3>A STANCH INHERITANCE.</h3>

<p>John Wanamaker, the boy, had no single thing in all
his surroundings to give him an advantage over any
one of hundreds of other boys in the city of Philadelphia.
Indeed, there were hundreds of other boys of his
own age for whom anyone would have felt safe in
prophesying a more notable career. But young Wanamaker
had an inheritance beyond that of almost any of
the others. It was not money; very few boys in all that
great city had less money than John Wanamaker, and
comparatively few families of average position but
were better off in the way of worldly goods. John
Wanamaker’s inheritance, that stood him in such good
stead in after life, was good health, good habits, a clean
mind, thrift in money matters, and tireless devotion to
whatever he thought to be duty.</p>

<p>He went to school some, not very much; he assisted
his mother in the house a great deal, and around his
father’s brickyard he was very helpful so far as a boy
could be helpful in such hard work. But he had ambition
beyond such things, and in 1852, when in his fifteenth
year, he found work with a publishing house at
$1.50 a week.</p>

<p>I know a number of people who were well acquainted
with John Wanamaker when he was a book publisher’s
boy. Most of them say that he was an exceptionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
promising boy; that he was studious as well as attentive
to business. Some of them declare that he used to
buy a book or some such gift for his mother regularly
with part of his savings. This may be partly romance,—the
exaggerated remembrance that most people have
of a boy who, as a man, cuts a notable figure in the
world. Very likely he did buy some books, but the
best that I can get is that, after all, he was very much
like other boys, except that he did not take kindly to
rough play, or do much playing of any kind, and that
he was saving of his money. He was earnest in his
work, unusually earnest for a boy, and so when, a
little later, he went to a Market street clothing house
and asked for a place, he had no difficulty in getting it,
nor had he any trouble in holding it.</p>


<h3>HE WAS ALWAYS PROMPT.</h3>

<p>His effort was to be first at the store in the morning,
and he was very likely to be one of the last, if not the
last at the store in the evening. But he did not expect
credit for this. Men who worked with him in the
Tower Hall clothing store say that he was always
bright, willing, accommodating, and very seldom out of
temper. If there was an errand, “John” was always
prompt and glad to do it. And so the store people liked
him, and the proprietor liked him, and, when he began
to sell clothing, the customers liked him. He was considerate
of their interests. He did not try to force
undesirable goods upon them. He treated them so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
when they came again they would be apt to ask, “Where
is John?” There was nothing in all this that any boy
could not have done; it is simply the spirit that any boy
or young man should show now,—must show if he expects
to succeed wonderfully. Of course this could
only lead to something higher. An ambitious young
man, such as John Wanamaker, was not to be contented
to sell goods all his days for other people. It was not
long before he became secretary of the Young Men’s
Christian Association at $1,000 a year. In the course
of a few years he had saved $2,000, when, joining with
a friend who had $2,000, they decided to open a clothing
store of their own.</p>

<p>Now here was successful growth without one single
outside influence to help the young man along. He got
his first situation without influence. He got into Tower
Hall without influence. His earnestness, activity and
ability got him the secretaryship. He saved $2,000
while other young men, who perhaps had earned many
times more than he, had saved nothing. He had made
friends among the customers of the old store, and he
had not only made friends of many of the employees
there, but he had impressed them all with the feeling
that here was a young man whom it was safe to tie to.
He had also made friends among church people and
helpful folk generally. All of this was great capital.</p>


<h3>STEP BY STEP UPWARD.</h3>

<p>At the very outset of his storekeeping, John Wanamaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
did what almost any other business man would
have stood aghast at. He chose the best man he knew
as a salesman in the clothing business in Philadelphia,
and agreed to pay him $1,350 a year,—one-third of the
entire capital of the new concern. It seemed reckless
extravagance. And there were other employees, too.
What could Mr. Wanamaker be thinking of to make the
promise of this great sum just for one assistant! This
move that seemed so audacious was really a very wise
one; for, when the new employee went with Mr. Wanamaker
to New York to buy goods, the fact of his association
added credit to the young house and so a little
money was eked out with a good deal more of credit,
and a very fair stock of goods was laid in. This was
just as the war began. Oak Hall was a success from
the start. Possibly, under the circumstances, any sort
of a clothing venture that had fair backing would have
been a success. But no ordinary concern could have
grown so rapidly and so healthfully as Oak Hall grew.</p>

<p>And right here another characteristic of Mr. Wanamaker’s
makeup strikingly manifested itself; <i>he was
not bound by precedent</i>. No matter how time-honored
a business method might be if it did not strike him as
the wisest, he put it aside at once. And from the first
he fully appreciated the importance of attracting public
attention. As a boy he had published “Everybody’s
Journal,”—a hodge-podge of odd bits with dabs of
original matter; notable then and now mainly because
it indicated the bent of the young mind. At Oak Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the same spirit of innovation was continually shown. It
has often been told how Mr. Wanamaker delivered his
first order in a wheelbarrow, and put the money ($38)
into an advertisement in “The Inquirer.” But this was
only one instance significant of the man.</p>


<h3>“WAKING UP” A TOWN.</h3>

<p>Philadelphia awoke one morning to find “W. &amp; B.”
in the form of six-inch square posters stuck up all over
the town. There was not another letter, no hint, just
“W. &amp; B.” Such things are common enough now, but
then the whole city was soon talking and wondering
what this sign meant. After a few days, a second poster
modestly stated that Wanamaker &amp; Brown had
begun to sell clothing at Oak Hall.</p>

<p>Of course the young firm got business rapidly. When
any man gets out of a rut and in the direction of more
enterprise, it helps him. Before long there were great
signs, each 100 feet in length, painted on special fences
built in a dozen places about the city, particularly near
the railroad stations. These told of the new firm and
were the first of a class that are now seen all over the
country. New ideas in advertising were cropping out.
In time balloons more than twenty feet high were sent
up, and a suit of clothes was given to each person who
brought one of them back. Whole counties were stirred
up by the balloons. It was grand advertising, imitated
since by all sorts of people. When the balloon idea
struck the Oak Hall management it was quickly found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
that the only way to get these air-ships was to make
them, and so, on the roof of the store, the cotton cloth
was cut and oiled and put together. Being well built,
and tied very tightly at the neck, they made long flights
and some of them were used over and over again. In
one instance, a balloon remained for more than six
months in a cranberry swamp, and when the great bag
was discovered, slowly swaying in the breeze, among
the bushes, the frightened Jerseymen thought they had
come upon an elephant, or, maybe, a survivor of the
mastodons. This made more advertising of the very
best kind for the clothing store,—the kind that excites
interested, complimentary talk.</p>


<h3>SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES.</h3>

<p>Genius consists in taking advantage of opportunities
quite as much as in making them. Here was a young
man doing things in an advertising way regardless of
the custom of the business world, and with a wonderful
knowledge of human nature. He took common-sense
advantage of opportunities that were open to everybody.</p>

<p>Soon after the balloon experience, tally-ho coaching
began to be a Philadelphia fad of the very exclusives.
Immediately afterward a crack coach was secured, and
six large and spirited horses were used instead of four,
and Oak Hall employees, dressed in the style of the
most ultra coaching set, traversed the country in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
direction, scattering advertising matter to the music of
the horn. Sometimes they would be a week on a trip.
No wonder Oak Hall flourished. It was kept in the
very front of the procession all the time.</p>

<p>A little later, in the yachting season, the whole town
was attracted and amused by processions and scatterings
of men, each wearing a wire body frame that supported
a thin staff from which waved a wooden burgee,
or pointed flag, reminding them of Oak Hall. Nearly
two hundred of these prototypes of the “Sandwich
man” were often out at one time.</p>

<p>But it was not only in the quick catching of a novel
advertising thought that the new house was making
history; in newspaper advertising, it was even further
in advance. The statements of store news were crisp
and unhackneyed, and the first artistic illustrations ever
put into advertisements were used there. So high was
the grade of this picture-work that art schools regularly
clipped the illustrations as models; and the world-famous
Shakespearean scholar, Dr. Horace Howard
Furness, treasured the original sketches of “The Seven
Ages” as among the most interesting in his unique collection.</p>

<p>As a storekeeper he was just as original. It was the
universal rule in those days, in the clothing trade, not
to mark the prices plainly on the goods that were for
sale. Within rather liberal bounds, the salesman got
what he could from the customer. Mr. Wanamaker,
after a time, instituted at Oak Hall the plan of “but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
price and that plainly marked,”—the beginning of still
another revolution in business methods. He saw to it
that customers had prompt and careful attention. If a
sale was missed, he required a written reason for it
from the salesman. There was no haphazard business
in that store,—nothing of the happy-go-lucky style.
Each man must be alert, wide-awake, attentive, or there
was no place for him at Oak Hall.</p>


<h3>ECONOMICAL WAYS.</h3>

<p>And Mr. Wanamaker’s habits of economy were never
relaxed. It is told of him that, in the earlier days of
Oak Hall, he used to gather up the short pieces of
string that came in on parcels, make them into a bunch,
and see that they were used when bundles were to be
tied. He also had a habit of smoothing out old newspapers,
and seeing that they were used as wrappers for
such things as did not require a better grade of paper.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the trade of the new store
came from people in the country districts. Mr. Wanamaker
had a way of getting close to them and gaining
their good will. An old employee of the firm says:
“John used to put a lot of chestnuts in his pocket along
in the fall and winter, and, when he had one of these
countrymen in tow, he’d slip a few of the nuts into the
visitor’s hand and both would go munching about the
store.” Another salesman of the old house says: “If
we saw a man come in chewing gum, we knew it was of
no use trying to sell him anything. You see, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sure to be as green as grass and fully convinced that
we were all watching for a chance to cheat him. John
said it was all nonsense; that such people came on purpose
to buy, and were the easiest people in the world to
sell to. And he would prove it. He would chew gum
with them, and talk farm or crops or cattle with them.
They’d buy of him every time. But none of us could
ever get his knack of dealing with countrymen.”</p>

<p>There it is. This young merchant understood human
nature. He put his customer at ease. He showed interest
in the things that interested the farmer. He was
frank and open with him, and just familiar enough not
to lose a bit of the respect and deference that superiority
commands.</p>


<h3>CHRISTIAN PHILANTHROPIST.</h3>

<p>Meantime Mr. Wanamaker was interesting himself
in Sunday school work, as well as in Christian Association
matters. He established a Sunday school in one of
the most unpromising of the down-town sections, and
there built up the largest school of the kind in the
world,—with a membership of something like three
thousand. This school proved a powerful factor for
good.</p>

<p>He was also active in general philanthropic work.
He was making his mark on almost every phase of the
city’s life. Such activity and forceful good sense are
always sure to make their mark.</p>

<p>When the great store was started in 1877 at Thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and Market streets, Mr. Wanamaker announced
certain fundamental principles that should mark the
course of the enterprise. The one-price thought was
continued, of course. But he went far beyond that. He
announced that <i>those who bought goods of him were to
be satisfied with what they bought, or have their money
back</i>.</p>

<p>To the old mercantile houses of the city this seemed
like committing business suicide. It was also unheard
of that special effort should be made to add to the comfort
of visitors, to make them welcome whether they
cared to buy or not, to induce them to look upon the
store as a meeting-place, a rendezvous, a resting-place,—a
sort of city home, almost. Yet these things that
were thought to forebode so much of disaster to the old
generation of merchants, have completely overturned
the methods of retailing throughout the United States.
That “Wanamaker way” is now almost the universal
way.</p>

<p>When asked what he attributed his great success to,
Mr. Wanamaker said: “To thinking, toiling, trying
and trusting in God.” Surely, his life has been crowded
with work. Even now, when wealth and honor have
been heaped upon him, he is likely to be the earliest man
at the store, and the last to leave at night,—just as when
a boy at Tower Hall.</p>


<h3>HIS ADVICE TO YOUNG MERCHANTS.</h3>

<p>He cares little for money, and even less for fame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
When I asked him to name the essentials of success, he
replied, curtly: “I might write a volume trying to tell
you how to succeed. One way is to not be above taking
a hint from a master. I don’t care to tell why I succeeded,
because I object to talking about myself. It
isn’t modest.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wanamaker is epigrammatical at times. I asked
him if a man with means but no experience would be
safe in embarking in a mercantile business, and he replied,
quickly:—</p>

<p>“A man can’t drive a horse who has never seen one.
No; a man must have training, must know how to buy
and sell; only experience teaches that.”</p>

<p>When I asked him whether the small tradesmen has
any “show” to-day against the great department stores,
he said:—</p>

<p>“All of the great stores were small at one time. Small
stores will keep on developing into big ones. You
wouldn’t expect a man to put an iron band around his
business in order to prevent expansion, would you?
There are, according to statistics, a greater number of
prosperous small stores in the city than ever before.
What better proof do you want?</p>

<p>“The department store is a natural product, evolved
from conditions that exist as a result of fixed trade
laws. Executive capacity, combined with command of
capital, finds opportunity in these conditions, which are
harmonious with the irresistible determination of the
producer to meet the consumer directly, and of merchandise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to find distribution along the lines of least
resistance. Reduced prices stimulate consumption and
increased employment, and it is sound opinion that the
increased employment created by the department stores
goes to women without curtailing that of men. In general
it may be stated that large retail stores have shortened
the hours of labor, and by systematic discipline
have made it lighter. The small store is harder upon
the sales-person and clerk. The effects upon the character
and capacity of the employees are good. A well-ordered,
modern retail store is a means of education in
spelling, writing, English language, system and method.
Thus it becomes to the ambitious and serious employees,
in a small way, a university, in which character is
broadened by intelligent instruction practically applied.”</p>

<p>A feature of his make-up that has contributed largely
to the many-sidedness of his success is his ability to
concentrate his thoughts. No matter how trivial the
subject that is brought before him, he takes it up with
the seeming of one who has nothing else on his mind.
While under the cares of his stores,—retail and wholesale,—of
the Sunday school, of the postmaster-generalship,
of vast railroad interests, of extensive real estate
transactions, and while he was weighing the demands
of leading citizens that he accept a nomination for
mayor of Philadelphia, I have seen him take up the
case of a struggling church society, or the troubles of
an individual, with the interest and patience that would
be expected of a pastor or a professional adviser. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is phenomenal in this respect. Probably not one young
man in a thousand <i>could</i> develop this trait so remarkably,
but any young man can try for it, and he will be all
the better and stronger for so trying.</p>

<p>In one physical particular Mr. Wanamaker is now
very remarkable; he can work continually for a long
time without sleep and without evidence of strain, and
make up for it by good rest afterward. This, perhaps,
is because of his lack of nervousness. He is always
calm. Under the greatest stress he never loses his head.
I fancy that this comes from training, as well as from
inheritance. It adds amazingly to the power that any
man can assert. It is certainly a tendency that can be
cultivated.</p>


<h3>CONDITIONS THEN AND NOW.</h3>

<p>I have heard it said a hundred times that Mr. Wanamaker
started when success was easy. Here is what he
says himself about it:—</p>

<p>“I think I could succeed as well now as in the past.
It seems to me that the conditions of to-day are even
more favorable to success than when I was a boy.
There are better facilities for doing business, and more
business to be done. Information in the shape of books
and newspapers is now in the reach of all, and the
young man has two opportunities where he formerly
had one.</p>

<p>“We are much more afraid of combinations of capital
than we have any reason for being. Competition regulates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
everything of that kind. No organization can
make immense profits for any length of time without
its field soon swarming with competitors. It requires
brain and muscle to manage any kind of business, and
the same elements which have produced business success
in the past will produce it now, and will always
produce it.”</p>

<p>I have heard others marvel at the unbroken upward
course of Mr. Wanamaker’s career, and lament that
they so often make mistakes. But hear him:—</p>

<p>“Who does not make mistakes? Why, if I were to
think only of the mistakes I have made, I should be
miserable indeed.”</p>


<h3>THE VALUE OF “PUSH.”</h3>

<p>He has exceptional skill in getting the best that is
possible out of his helpers. On one occasion he said:—</p>

<p>“We are very foolish people if we shut our ears and
eyes to what other people are doing. I often pick up
things from strangers. As you go along, pick up suggestions
here and there, jot them down and send them
along. Even writing them down helps to concentrate
your mind on that part of the work. You need not be
afraid of overstepping the mark and stepping on somebody’s
heels. The more we push each other, the better.”</p>

<p>This is another Wanamaker characteristic: he wants
everyone associated with him to “push.” Stagnation
and death are very nearly synonymous words in his
vocabulary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of it all stands a man who has been monumentally
successful as a merchant and in general business;
a man who has helped his fellow-man while helping
himself.</p>

<p>The lesson of such a life should be precious to every
young man. It teaches the value of untiring effort,
of economy, of common sense applied to common business.
It gives one more proof that no height of success
is, in this country, beyond the reasonable ambition of
any youth who desires to succeed.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that thousands on thousands of
young men in the United States are to-day better
equipped in almost every way than was John Wanamaker
when he began business for himself in 1861.
Very likely, not one in a hundred of them will make a
mark of any significance. The fault will be their own,—they
will not have the compelling force that comes
from “thinking, toiling, trying,” and the serene confidence
that <i>then</i> comes from “trusting” a guiding power
through every change of circumstances.</p>

<h2 class='num'>VII<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>A British Boy Wins Fortune and
Title by American Business
Methods.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE lower bay was charged with subdued excitement
everywhere as the “Water Witch”
hove to alongside Sir Thomas J. Lipton’s
“Erin,” and I stepped aboard. The hum of
preparation for the great race was heard above the lapping
waves. Fresh and keen came the breezes from the
snowy ridges of the ocean’s breast. A thousand spreads
of sail studded the bay, the great ships standing up in
fixed majesty, the smaller vessels darting here and there
in the wind, while right in the path of the sun’s glare
lay the green hull of the “Shamrock.” Along the
whitened shores beyond were hundreds of fishing craft
dancing at their work, and in the offing were the smoke-stacks
of the Atlantic liners.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” came a cheery sailor’s voice from
the promenade deck. “Step right up here and you will
get a better view of our little beauty.”</p>

<p>The voice belonged to Sir Thomas Lipton, and the
“little beauty” was the dainty craft to which he had
pinned his faith. The Scotch-Irish knight was as enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as a boy. With a cordial handshake, he led
the way to the rail and pointed to the emerald swan
below.</p>

<p>“There she is,” he tenderly exclaimed; “the pride of
a nation; isn’t she a picture!” His tone fairly caressed
the graceful thing. I fully expected to see him clamber
down the rope-way and go out to pet her, as the Arab is
said to pet his steed, but he satisfied himself by gazing
at her and talking about her.</p>

<p>Confessedly, I was more interested in her owner than
in the “Shamrock,” but I was too diplomatic to show
it, so I quite won my way into his heart by praising her.</p>


<h3>SIR THOMAS WAS WON.</h3>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” I said, “I can’t say I hope she will
win, but I hope she will come so close to it that she will
turn us all green with envy!”</p>

<p>“Ah, my boy, that’s the spirit,” he said; “that’s why
it’s a pleasure to race against you Americans. You
meet a fellow more than half way.”</p>

<p>The “Erin” is no less beautiful than the racer. With
the “Shamrock’s” pennant at the foremast and the Stars
and Stripes flying from the after-pole, she is a model.
Commodore Morgan says she is one of the three finest
ocean-going yachts in the world. The Prince and Princess
of Wales visited her often, and gave signed photographs
of themselves to hang in the elegant cabin.
Admiral Dewey’s likeness hangs near the “Columbia’s.”
The appointments of the yacht are worthy of the Waldorf-Astoria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Sir Thomas never leaves her, he told
me, except to go aboard the “Shamrock.” I could not
blame him. Finding a pair of upholstered steamer
chairs forward, we dropped into them.</p>

<p>The conversation drifted into the early struggles of
the baronet, to the days when he did not own a floating
palace or an international cup challenger.</p>


<h3>WHEN HE BORROWED FIVE CENTS.</h3>

<p>“I remember, as if it were yesterday,” said Sir
Thomas, “how utterly hopeless my financial condition
seemed to be when I was a boy of fifteen in New York.
I had run away from home to see the world. My experiences
were anything but pleasant, without work as
I was, a stranger in a great city. I got used to living
on a few cents a day, but when it came to such a pinch
that I couldn’t buy a five-cent stamp to carry a letter to
the old folks in Glasgow, I very nearly gave up. I
really think that decided me to go back. It accentuated
my homesickness. I thought of the prodigal son. I
borrowed five cents for that letter, and resolved to get
back as soon as a chance offered. I can tell you I was
glad when I once more set foot on the other side. I
had refrained from telling my people how hard up I
had been. This was largely a matter of pride with me,
but another consideration was their feelings. I would
do anything rather than distress them. So I stepped
up, on my arrival, as jauntily as you ever saw a lad, and
when a proposition was made to me by my father, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
after my home-coming, to set me up in a small grocery,
I jumped at the chance.”</p>

<p>“Was that the beginning of your fortune?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I made money from the start. I put in practice
what I had seen abroad,—such as displaying goods
attractively in windows, keeping the place as neat as a
pin, and waiting personally on my customers. Every
dollar that I earned I saved,—not that I really loved
money myself. That was not my inspiration,—it was
my father and mother.”</p>


<h3>AMERICAN BUSINESS METHODS GAVE HIM HIS START.</h3>

<p>“I am willing to admit that it was my admiration for
American methods that gave me my start,” said Sir
Thomas, as he leaned against the taffrail. “It was the
application of proper methods to conditions that needed
them. These applications and conditions are always
with us. The world is full of them. A man only needs
to know both when he sees them.</p>

<p>“We have all marveled at the prosperity of America,
but, years ago, I felt that it would come. But your
country is still young, and has many more victories to
win. I may say the same thing of all the world. Every
country has a future still. Honest competition will still
give all the nations a chance for supremacy. It only
remains for the people to catch those chances, and not
let them pass by. If I were a poor man to-day, I would
be just as happy; I know that I could start anew and
win.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Honest application is the stimulus of all effort.
That, to me, is the science of achievement. Whenever
you find an opportunity to do something that will benefit
you, do not fail to take advantage of it. Often, the
most trying periods will produce the best results. For
instance, fifteen years ago, while sailing down the African
coast in a steamer which carried, as the bulk of its
cargo, my teas, we encountered a terrific storm. The
steamer had to be lightened. At one time it even looked
as if we were going to be wrecked; but, really, I
thought more of the loss of that tea than of anything
else. I had it brought on deck, with the idea of using
it for advertising purposes, if for nothing else. On each
case I had painted, in large black letters, ‘Lipton’s Tea,’
and then cast it overboard, dreaming that it would float
to the African coast, and be picked up by someone who
had not heard of the product before. Sure enough, it
was.”</p>


<h3>HE OWNS NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED STORES.</h3>

<p>“Your business must be an enormous one now, Sir
Thomas, from the stories in the English papers about
the organization of your enterprises into a limited company.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have a good deal to attend to,” he said, smiling.
“I have sixty stores in London alone, and four
hundred and twenty the world over, most of them being
in the British Isles. I sell all food products except beef,
which I have never handled. I own thousands of acres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on the island of Ceylon, where I am the largest individual
land-owner. On this land I grow tea, coffee and
cocoa, and employ several thousand natives to cultivate
and ship it. I have warehouses all over Asia, and
branch stores in Hamburg and Berlin. In Chicago I
have a packing-house where I sometimes kill three
thousand hogs in a day. So, you see, my enterprises
are pretty well scattered over the earth.</p>

<p>“How many employees have I? Well, all in all, I
have somewhat over ten thousand, and a nicer lot of
employees you never saw. I have never had a strike,
and never expect to have one, for I make it my personal
duty to see that my men are all comfortably fixed. We
live together in perfect harmony.”</p>

<p>“And what advice would you give young men who
are about to start out for themselves, Sir Thomas?”</p>

<p>“That’s a broad question,” laughed the great man.
“It would take me some time to answer it properly.
But, to begin with, I say that hard work is the cardinal
requisite for success. I always feel that I cannot impress
that fact too strongly upon young men. And
then a person’s heart and soul must be in his work.
He must be earnest, above all, and willing to give his
whole time to his work, if necessary. Honesty, it goes
without saying, is necessary, and if you want to be
wholly successful, you must do unto others as you
would have them do unto you. If you don’t, they will
be sure to retaliate, when you least expect it. If young
men would follow these rules, they would get along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
very well; but few of them will. If your article can
inspire any of them to harder work, its mission will be
blessed.”</p>


<h3>CHANCES FOR YOUNG MEN TO-DAY.</h3>

<p>I inquired whether the chances for young men in
Great Britain are equal to those in America.</p>

<p>“That is a difficult question to answer,” said Sir
Thomas. “Being a merchant, I can speak of trade
opportunities, but in the professions I really do not
know which side of the Atlantic is the better. Literature,
of course, knows no country; neither does art. In
the legal profession, the chances are two to one in favor
of the United States. You make more of your lawyers
there; you utilize them in legislation, in places of trust,
while abroad their duties are limited. A good physician
in England will probably make as much money as your
leading ones here. Taking it altogether, there seems to
be as good a chance for professional men on one side
as on the other. The British isles are small compared
with the states, but young men are going out every day
into new British fields, just as your young men are
pushing out into every part of your magnificent stretch
of country.</p>


<h3>“THRIFT IS THE TRUE SECRET OF SUCCESS.”</h3>

<p>“When men tell you,” continued the baronet, “that
there are no more chances in this world, tell them that
they are mistaken. Your country abounds in so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that I marvel why any American cares to leave its
shores. There are thousands of manufactures that are
still in an imperfect state; there are millions of acres
that are still to be made productive; there are, seemingly,
countless achievements yet to be undertaken.
What I say is best proven by the international yacht
races. Every year we race we believe that we have
produced the best possible boat, but we find, after the
race is over, that we can improve it in some respect. If
all men would use their minds in the same way that the
builders of these big yachts use theirs, what a world of
improvement would be made! After every race, we
produce something better, something finer,—the result
of brains and workmanship,—and we are not satisfied
yet.</p>

<p>“I have often been asked to define the true secret of
success. It is thrift in all its phases, and, principally,
thrift as applied to saving. A young man may have
many friends, but he will find none so steadfast, so constant,
so ready to respond to his wants, so capable of
pushing him ahead, as a little leather-covered book,
with the name of a bank on its cover. Saving is the
first great principle of all success. It creates independence,
it gives a young man standing, it fills him with
vigor, it stimulates him with the proper energy; in fact,
it brings to him the best part of any success,—happiness
and contentment. If it were possible to inject the
quality of saving into every boy, we would have a great
many more real men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Success depends also on character to carry it
through life.</p>

<p>“Knowledge should be a compound of what we derive
from books, and what we extract, by our observation,
from the living world around us. Both of these
are necessary to the well-informed man; and, of the
two, the last is, by far, the most useful for the practical
purposes of life. The man who can combine the teachings
of books with strong and close observation of life,
deserves the name of a well-informed man, and presents
a model worthy of imitation.”</p>

<p>The great passion of Sir Thomas’s life, yachting, has
been a costly indulgence for him, yet he has inadvertently
secured more popularity through his efforts to
win the “America’s” Cup than would have been possible
in any other way. The three “Shamrocks” have cost
him, all told, reckoning the expenses of sailing the races
as part of the grand total, more than one million dollars.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Self-made Man who Strives to
Give others a Chance</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>“IF a bootblack does all the good he possibly can
for his fellowmen, his life has been just as
successful as that of the millionaire who helps
thousands.”</p>

<p>That was what Darius Ogden Mills said when I
asked him to give me his idea of a successful life. His
next reply was quite as epigrammatic.</p>

<p>“What, Mr. Mills, do you consider the keynote of
success?”</p>

<p>“Work,” he replied, quickly and emphatically.
“Work develops all the good there is in a man; idleness
all the evil. Work sharpens all his faculties and
makes him thrifty; idleness makes him lazy and a
spendthrift. Work surrounds a man with those whose
habits are industrious and honest; in such society a
weak man develops strength, and a strong man is made
stronger. Idleness, on the other hand, is apt to throw
a man into the company of men whose only object in
life usually is the pursuit of unwholesome and demoralizing
diversions.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mills is quite averse to being interviewed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
when I told him that his words would be carried to
many thousands of young men, and probably do considerable
good in the way of encouragement and inspiration,
he consented to a brief talk.</p>


<h3>AN AGE OF OPPORTUNITIES.</h3>

<p>I asked Mr. Mills when he would be ready for me,
and he replied:—</p>

<p>“I am just as ready now as I ever will be. There is
no time like the present.”</p>

<p>Like an oasis in the desert is the experience of a man,
the accumulation of whose wealth has been on lines
parallel with the conducive rather than counter to the
welfare of mankind. This is what Mr. Mills says on
the subject:—</p>

<p>“A man can, in the accumulation of a fortune, be
just as great a benefactor of mankind as in the distribution
of it. In organizing a great industry, one opens
up fields of employment for a multitude of people who
might otherwise be practically helpless, giving them
not only a chance to earn a living for themselves and
their families, but also to lay by a competency for old
age. All honest, sober men, if they have half a chance,
can do that; but only a small percentage can ever become
rich. Now the rich man, having acquired his
wealth, knows better how to manage it than those
under him would, and having actual possession, he has
the power to hold the community of his employees and
their interests together, and prevent disintegration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which means disaster so much oftener to the employee
than to the employer.”</p>

<p>Volumes of fascinating matter could be written of
the career of Mr. Mills, but the purpose of this article
is a talk with, rather than a talk about him.</p>

<p>“To what formative influence do you attribute your
material success, Mr. Mills?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I was taught very early that I would have to depend
entirely upon myself; that my future lay in my
own hands. I had that for a start, and it was a good
one. I didn’t waste any time bothering about succession
to wealth, which so often acts as a drag upon
young men. Many persons waste the best years of
their lives waiting for dead men’s shoes; and, when
they get them, find them entirely too big to wear gracefully,
simply because they have not developed themselves
to wear them. I have never accepted an inheritance
or anything but goodwill from my family or relatives.”</p>


<h3>THE FIRST HUNDRED DOLLARS.</h3>

<p>“As a rule, the small inheritance, which, to a boy,
would seem large, has a tendency to lessen his efforts,
and is a great damage to him in the way of acquiring
habits necessary to success. Above all, no one can
acquire a fortune unless he makes a start; and the
habit of thrift, which he learns in saving his first hundred
dollars, is of inestimable value later on. It is not
the money, but the habit which counts. There is no
one so helpless as a man who is ‘broke,’ no matter how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
capable he may be, and there is no habit so detrimental
to his reputation among business men as that of borrowing
small sums of money. This cannot be too
emphatically impressed upon young men. Another
thing is that none but the wealthy, and very few of
them, can afford the indulgence of expensive habits;
how much less then can a man with only a few dollars
in his pockets? More young men are ruined by the
expense of smoking than in any other way. The money
thus laid out would make them independent, in many
cases, or at least would give them a good start. A
young man should be warned by the melancholy example
of those who have been ruined by smoking, and
avoid it.”</p>


<h3>TRAITS OF INFLUENTIAL MEN.</h3>

<p>“What marked traits have the influential men, with
whom you have been associated, possessed, which most
impressed you?”</p>

<p>“A habit of thinking and acting for themselves. No
end of people are ruined by taking the advice of others.
This may answer temporarily, but in the long run it is
sure to be disastrous. Any man who hasn’t ability to
judge for himself would better get a comfortable clerkship
somewhere, letting some one of more ambition and
ability do the thinking necessary to run the business.”</p>

<p>“Are the opportunities for making money as numerous
to-day as they were when you started in business?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the progress of science and invention has increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the opportunities a thousandfold, and a man
can find them wherever he seeks them, in the United
States in particular. It has caused the field of employment
of labor of all kinds to expand enormously, thus
creating opportunities which never existed before. It
is no longer necessary for a man to go to foreign countries
or distant parts of his own country to make money.
Opportunities come to him in every quarter. There is
hardly a point in the country so obscure that it has not
felt the revolutionizing influence of commercial enterprise.
Probably railroads and electricity are the chief
instruments in this respect. Other industries follow
closely in their wake.”</p>


<h3>SOME SECRETS OF SUCCESS.</h3>

<p>“In what part of the country do you think the best
chances for young men may be found?”</p>

<p>“The best place for a young man to make money is
the town in which he was born and educated. There
he learns all about everybody, and everybody learns
about him. This is to his advantage if he bears a good
character, and to the advantage of his townspeople if he
bears a bad one. While a young man is growing up,
he unconsciously absorbs a vast deal of knowledge of
people and affairs, which would be equal to money if
he only has the judgment to avail himself of it. A
knowledge of men is the prime secret of business success.
Upon reflection, how absurd it is for a man to
leave a town where he knows everything and everybody,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and go to some distant point where he doesn’t
know anything about anybody, or anything, and expect
to begin on an equal footing with the people there who
are thoroughly acquainted.”</p>

<p>“What lesson do you consider best for young men to
learn?”</p>

<p>“The lesson of humility;—not in the sense of being
servile or undignified, but in that of paying due respect
to men who are their superiors in the way of experience,
knowledge and position. Such a lesson is akin
to that of discipline. Members of the royal families of
Europe are put in subordinate positions in the navies or
armies of their respective countries, in order that they
may receive the training necessary to qualify them to
take command. They must first know how to obey, if
they would control others.”</p>


<h3>THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER.</h3>

<p>“In this country, it is customary for the sons of the
presidents of great railroads, or other companies, to
begin at the bottom of the ladder and work their way
up step by step, just the same as any other boy in the
employ of the corporation. This course has become
imperatively necessary in the United States, where each
great business has become a profession in itself. Most
of the big machine shops number among their employees,
scions of old families who carry dinner pails,
and work with files or lathes, the same as anyone else.
Such shoulder-to-shoulder experience is invaluable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a man who is destined to command, because he not only
masters the trade technically, but learns all about the
men he works with and qualifies himself to grapple
with labor questions which may arise.</p>

<p>“There is no end of conspicuous examples of the
wisdom of this system in America. There are also
many instances of disaster to great industrial concerns
due to the inexperience or the lack of tact of men placed
suddenly in control.”</p>

<p>“What is the responsibility of wealth, Mr. Mills?”</p>

<p>“A man must learn not to think too much of money.
It should be considered as a means and not an end, and
the love for it should never be permitted to so warp a
man’s mind as to destroy his interest in progressive
ideas. Making money is an education, and the wide
experience thus acquired teaches a man discrimination
in both men and projects, where money is under consideration.
Very few men who make their own money
use it carelessly. Most good projects that fail owe
their failure to bad business management, rather than
to lack of intrinsic merit. An inventor may have a
very good thing, and plenty of capital may be enlisted,
but if a man not acquainted with the peculiar
line, or one who is not a good salesman or financier be
employed as manager, the result is disastrous. A
man should spend his money in a way that tends to
advance the best interests of society in the country he
lives in, or in his own neighborhood at least. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
is only one thing that is a greater harm to the community
than a rich spendthrift, and that is a miser.”</p>


<h3>A WORD ABOUT CHEAP HOTELS.</h3>

<p>“How did you happen to establish the system of
hotels which bear your name, Mr. Mills?”</p>

<p>“I had been looking around for several years to find
something to do that would be for the good of the community.
My mind was largely on other matters, but it
occurred to me that the hotel project was the best, and I
immediately went to work at it. My purpose was to
do the work on so large a scale that it would be appreciated
and spread all over the country, for as the
sources of education extend, we find more and more
need of assisting men who have a disposition for decency
and good citizenship. The mechanic is well paid,
and the man who has learned to labor is much more
independent than he who is prepared for a profession,
science or other objects in life that call for higher education.
Clerks commencing at small salaries need good
surroundings and economy to give themselves a start.
Such are the men for whom the hotels were established.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Thrift, the Secret of a Fortune Built
in a Single Lifetime.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>VERY few great fortunes have been acquired by
one man, or within the limits of a single lifetime.
The vast wealth of the Vanderbilts,
the Astors, and many others, has accumulated
through several generations. It is seldom, indeed, that
a fortune like that of Russell Sage is amassed by one
man. For years, the newspapers of the country have
been filled with stories of his eccentricities.</p>

<p>When I called at the great banker’s office, I found it
very hard to obtain an audience with Mr. Sage, even
though I had an introduction to him. He has so often
been the victim of cranks, and has so many callers at
his office, that he has been obliged to deny himself to
all alike. He finally decided to see me. I found him
seated at an old flat-topped desk, looking over the
stock reports of the day, and I was surprised at the
extreme simplicity of all his surroundings. The furnishings
of the room looked as if they might have seen
service before the Civil War, and, upon later inquiry,
I learned that most of the chairs and the desk itself
have been in use by Mr. Sage for more than twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
years. He has become so attached to them that he
cannot think of discarding them for more modern inventions.
Mr. Sage is smooth-faced, and his hair is
thin and gray. His clothes are fashioned in the style
of thirty years ago, but of good material, and well
kept. His shoulders are bent with care and age, but his
face has a good color, and a happy smile that betokens
health and a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>“I have come to ask you to tell me the story of your
life,” I said, “for I am sure it must be of great interest.”</p>


<h3>HE BEGAN AS A GROCERY CLERK.</h3>

<p>Mr. Sage smiled. “I don’t know about its being of
interest. It is very simple and commonplace to me.
You know I began as a grocery clerk, in a country
town. That is a very humble beginning, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s the beginning that counts,” I said;
“not the end.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” replied the financier. “Well, when
I was even younger than you are, I received a dollar
a week for working from early morning until late at
night, but I was well satisfied with my lot, because I
knew that it was bound to lead to better things. So I
worked my very best, and saved my wages, which were
slowly increased as I went along, and finally I had
enough money to start a little store for myself. When
I was twenty-one years old, I had a store of my own,
and I made a success of it, too.” He smiled, as he remembered
those early days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“But how did you happen to come to New York?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was ambitious,” laughed Mr. Sage. “Like
most boys, I thought there was no other place like a
city for success, and I finally sold my country store
when I was still very young, and came to New York.
I started in as an office-boy, at very low wages, and,
from that day on, I worked myself up and up, until
I finally became a financier on my own account. It
took a long time, though. It wasn’t all accomplished
in a day; though, when I came to New York, I expected
to be rich in two or three years. I was very
much like other boys, you see. They all expect to get
rich in a day.”</p>

<p>“But some of them never get rich,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s their own fault if they don’t succeed,”
said the financier. “Surely, everyone has as good a
chance as I had. I don’t think there could be a poorer
opportunity for a boy to rise. The trouble is that most
of them are not very anxious to rise. If they find themselves
wealthy some morning they are glad, of course;
but they are not willing to work and make themselves
rich.”</p>


<h3>NO LUCK IN HIS ACHIEVEMENT.</h3>

<p>“Some say that it is all luck,” I ventured to suggest.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” said Mr. Sage, with great disgust.
“There’s no such thing as luck. I’m sure there was
none of it about my career. I know just how I earned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
every penny, and the reason for it, and I never got
anything I didn’t work for. I never knew anyone to
obtain lasting wealth without lots of hard work.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 314px;">
<img src="images/illus02.jpg" width="314" height="500" alt="Boy and girl outside" />
<div class="caption">CHILDHOOD</div>
</div>

<p>“Do you think there are as good opportunities for
getting rich to-day as there were thirty years ago, or
when you made your start, Mr. Sage?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. I think there are even greater opportunities,
for new industries are being established all
the time, and there are broader fields to work in. But
then, the old fields of business are not overworked,
by any means. I always say that there is room for
good men anywhere and at any time. I don’t think
there can be ever too many of them. It is true that
there are many applicants for every place in New York,
but if I were unable to get a place in an eastern city, I
should go west, for there are great opportunities there
for everyone.”</p>

<p>“People say, though, that the west is not what it is
supposed to be,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, there are always pessimists,” said Mr. Sage.
“The people who say the west has no opportunities are
the same persons who used to call it foolish for any
young man to come to New York. When I decided
to come here, I was told on every side that I would regret
my action; but I never have. Some people never
see opportunities in anything, and they never get along.
I didn’t see any very great opportunity ahead of me
when I came to New York, but I knew that, if I had a
chance, I could make one. I knew that there are always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
openings for energetic, hard-working fellows, and I
was right.”</p>


<h3>STRICT HONESTY IS NECESSARY.</h3>

<p>“Of course, you believe that strict honesty is essential
to success, Mr Sage? I’ve heard many people
say that honesty doesn’t pay, especially in Wall street.”</p>

<p>“That is a foolish question,” said the financier. “It
is absurd to imagine that it pays to be dishonest, whatever
your business or profession. Do you suppose, if
I had been dishonest in any dealings when I started out,
that I would be worth anything to-day?”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the chances for country boys
in a great city like New York to-day, Mr. Sage?”</p>

<p>“I think they are as great as ever. Employers are
on the lookout for bright young men, and I believe
that they would prefer that they come from the country,
provided there is no danger of their becoming
dissipated. I think that is the only thing men have
against country fellows, and there are many things in
their favor. I think an earnest, ambitious, hard-working
boy from the country has a splendid chance of becoming
somebody. There are much greater opportunities
for him to exercise his good qualities, and the
reward of his enterprise is much larger. The same
energetic labor that would make a man worth twenty-five
thousand dollars in a small town would be very
likely to make him worth a hundred thousand or so in
a great city, and all on account of the wider field.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“To what do you owe your wonderful vitality?” I
asked. Mr. Sage smiled before answering me.</p>

<p>“I never smoke, I never drink any liquors, I retire
early, and get up early, and take care of myself in
every possible way,” he said. “Don’t you think I ought
to be healthy? I have always taken care of myself, and
I think I’ve proved that hard work is not bad for one’s
health. In fact, I think that work is the best thing I
know of for improving a man’s constitution, for it
makes a good appetite, and encourages digestion. It
isn’t work that ruins so many men. It’s the wine they
drink, and the late hours they keep, and their general
dissipation. I expect to be at my desk for many years
to come, and just because I’ve taken good care of
myself.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Cut Out for a Banker, He Rose
from Errand Boy to Secretary
of the U. S. Treasury.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>“IN my own career, I have learned that varied
experience in early youth is often of great
value in after life. My schooldays ended
when I was fourteen years old, and I began
work as a mail agent on the Rome, Watertown
and Ogdensburg Railroad. I do not mean to say
that, when I stopped school, my education ceased, for
it was after 1850 that my character received its greatest
development. I was but poorly satisfied with my work
as mail agent, although it taught me much that I didn’t
know before, and I kept my eyes open for something
better. In a short time, the death of the president of
the United States resulted in the loss of my first position.
The village postmaster was removed from office,
and, of course, my dismissal followed. This was discouraging,
but I re-entered the village academy to pursue,
for a time, my studies. There was in our town a
small bank, and this institution had always possessed a
fascination for my youthful mind. I used to watch the
merchants going in with bags of gold and bundles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
greenbacks, and coming out again with only account
books in their hands. I knew that the bank had some
connection with the government, and, being greatly impressed
with its dignified appearance and the actions of
its officers, I was seized with a desire to work within
its walls. When I applied for a position, I learned that
there was no likelihood of a vacancy occurring in the
near future; so, when I was offered a place in a local
stationery shop at a salary of a hundred dollars a year,
I accepted with alacrity. The wages were small, indeed,
but in this shop I was privileged to become
acquainted with general literature, and spent many
hours with the great authors. So the months with the
stationer were not without profit.</p>

<p>“After a time there was a rival bank established in
the town, and I was offered the position of ‘messenger
and general assistant,’ at the same old salary of a hundred
dollars a year. I didn’t hesitate, but left the store
to enter the bank, and so began my career in the financial
world. My duties as ‘general assistant’ were many
and varied. I was janitor, first of all, and attended to
the heating of the building. I made many trips every
day to the cellar for coal, and I used to think the officials
most extravagant when they insisted on a fire
when the days were comparatively warm. I was
obliged to keep the front sidewalk clear of dirt in the
summer and of snow in the winter, and had to sweep
the floor of the banking room daily, and dust the desks
and furniture frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHEN YOU START IN LIFE IN A STRANGE CITY, DO NOT
EXPECT “SOFT SNAPS.”</h3>

<p>“As the ‘messenger’ of the bank, I was sent around
town with notices of notes which had fallen due, and
with drafts which had been sent to the bank for collection
from other cities. All these duties kept me fairly
busy, but I still had time to learn something of banking
as a business, and of the transactions which took place
behind the counters. As the business of the bank increased,
the teller and the bookkeeper welcomed my
assistance in their departments; and, when summer
came, and there were no fires to make and no snow to
shovel, I had opportunity to learn most of the details of
the business. After a while I was intrusted with the
work of the teller or of the bookkeeper when either was
kept at home by illness, and at the end of my first year
I felt that I was indeed ‘cut out for a banker.’</p>

<p>“I had so good an opinion of my accomplishments
that I demanded of my employers an increase of salary
for my second year. They replied that I was receiving
all they could afford to pay, and I immediately resigned.
At this time, nearly every boy in Central New York had
the ‘Western Fever,’ and, after I left the bank, I developed
a very bad case. I determined to start for Chicago
to make my fortune, and arrived there one day in
1855, with few dollars and no friends. I had my mind
made up to be a banker, and supposed that it would be
easier to find an opening in the western city than it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
been in my native village. But when I made the
rounds, I found that no embryo banker was needed. I
could not afford to be idle, so I determined to accept
the first position which should offer, whether or not it
was to my liking. It does not pay for a young man
starting in life in a strange city to be too particular
about what he does for a living. I soon found a place
as bookkeeper for a lumber company. The panic of
1857 effected even bookkeepers, however; and, when
the firm found it necessary to reduce expenses, I gladly
accepted appointment as night watchman.</p>

<p>“I had been in Chicago three years before good fortune
seemed to come my way. I had visited every
banking house several times in search of a position, for
I was convinced that banking ought to be my career,
and I was a familiar applicant to all the officials. On
the third of August, 1858, a date I shall always remember,
I was summoned to the office of the Merchants’
Loan and Trust Company, where my name was on file
as a candidate for any position, however humble. ‘Can
you keep a set of books?’ asked Mr. Holt, the cashier.
‘I can try,’ was my answer. ‘That isn’t what we
want,’ said Mr. Holt; ‘can you do it?’ ‘I can, if it
can be done in twenty-three hours out of twenty-four,’
I replied, and I was thereupon engaged at an annual
salary of five hundred dollars. After working for so
long at uncongenial employment with low wages, this
opening made me very happy. I felt that my future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was assured, for I had obtained, at length, the long-desired
standing-room in a Chicago bank.</p>


<h3>THE PUBLIC WOULD RATHER INVEST ITS MONEY IN MEN
THAN IN FINE BUILDINGS.</h3>

<p>“The story of my further progress can be of little interest
to those who are beginning life in the financial
world. My early preparation in the New York village
was most useful, and, since I had also benefited from
my experience with the world, my position was secure.
If a young man has some preparation for his work, if
he secures a proper opening, and if he behaves himself,
there can be no question of his future. In two years
after I entered the service of the Merchants’ Loan and
Trust Company, I was given the position of cashier, at
an annual salary of two thousand dollars, and naturally
I was encouraged to find that my efforts were appreciated.
I enjoyed my work, and was more convinced
than ever before that banking was the career for which
I was best fitted by nature.</p>

<p>“Every successful man started in a different way
from that adopted by any other, and there is no rule
which can be laid down as certain to win in the end.
Some have received the benefit of a college training,
and others have been self-educated. Some began life
in other business and drifted into banking, and some
were employed in financial houses from the very beginning.
It often happens that those who make the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
earnest efforts to succeed accomplish less than others
who have had less preparation for the work. The
prizes of life do not always come to the most deserving.
Many things must co-operate to bring great results.
Innate ability, which schools cannot furnish, must find
conjunction with conditions, circumstances, and opportunities
which lie outside of individual control. If you
find a man great, distinguished, a business Saul among
his brethren, do not worship him overmuch. Perhaps
among the humble and unrecognized are a score or a
hundred as worthy as he, to whom circumstances were
unfavorable or opportunity did not come.</p>

<p>“The public appreciates more and more the importance
of investing money in men, not in buildings.
When I hear of large gifts to erect magnificent halls at
our colleges, I think what greater good would be accomplished
if that money were used to help a number
of deserving young men and women through their college
courses. When these young people have finished
their work in the world, they may each and all be able
to erect fifty-thousand-dollar buildings for their <i>alma
maters</i>. A certain generous-minded man once said to
me, ‘I have given money quite freely to help the distressed,
to soften the bitterness of helpless age, and to
alleviate the condition of the unfortunate; but there
was little or no inspiration in it. When, on the other
hand, I have helped a bright boy to secure for himself
a good education, my imagination has become
effected. I have seen my dollars—won by hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
application, in sordid ways,—transmitted into intellectual
agencies powerful to effect the thoughts and
feelings of generations which will live when I am
dead.’ This sentiment is becoming prevalent among
the thoughtful men of America.”</p>

<h2 class="num">XI<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Young Millionaire not Afraid to
Work in Overalls.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>A TALL, slender young man walked into the
office of the master of motive power and
construction, in the Grand Central Station,
New York. He was dressed in clothes that
showed marks of travel, and his face had a tired look.
This was young Cornelius Vanderbilt, son of the head
of the house of Vanderbilt, and great-grandson of his
namesake, the founder of the Vanderbilt fortune. Cornelius
had come to the office to report to the man
under whom he is working, for the heir to the Vanderbilt
millions was then serving his apprenticeship in the
railroad business, and had to report the work he had
accomplished, just like any other young mechanic on
the road. Every clerk in the office stared at him, but
the stare was affectionate, for every employee of the
road has learned to like him. They have seen him
with jacket and overalls, working in the yards and in
the round-houses and machine-shops all along the
system.</p>

<p>“It was not a sudden determination which led me to
go out on the road and study the practical side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
railroad business,” said young Cornelius Vanderbilt,
in answer to my question as to his motive; “I had long
intended to do it, because I know that the best way to
learn a business is to begin at the bottom and work up.
So when Mr. Depew arranged for me to begin in this
department, I gladly accepted the place. I have been
out on the road, off and on, for several months, and
feel that I have learned a great deal that I could never
have learned in any other way.”</p>


<h3>FROM THE FOUNDATION UP.</h3>

<p>“I have enjoyed the experience, too. I think I have
had a natural inclination for mechanics all my life, and
I enjoyed having to do with engines and the construction
of the road-bed. I am learning, gradually, of
course, to build an engine, and to run one successfully.
It won’t be long before I can do that.”</p>

<p>“And what will you undertake when you have finished
with the construction and motive-power departments?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t planned that far ahead yet, but I
hope, eventually, to know as much about the finances
of the road as I do about the mechanics, and I also
want to know something of the way in which the road
is managed. All this will take time, but I am determined
to give it all the time it needs. I think the advantages
to be derived from such a training are worth
a great deal of time and work.”</p>

<p>“Does it seem like very hard work to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; you know, I’m very much interested in such
things, and so I don’t mind the work. I would much
prefer working in the yards and round-houses to working
in the offices. It is much more to my taste.”</p>

<p>I asked Mr. Vanderbilt whether he ever expected to
run an engine attached to a train, and he said he had
no idea of doing so, but he could, if necessary. “I’m
glad to know how,” he said.</p>

<p>And then Mr. Vanderbilt went to attend to some
work awaiting him outside, and I entered Mr. Depew’s
office. When I asked Mr. Depew to tell me something
more of the young man whom he has so nobly befriended
in all his trials, he spoke with great animation.</p>


<h3>WISE DEVELOPMENT OF INHERITED TENDENCIES.</h3>

<p>“Cornelius,” said he, “is a remarkable youth. From
his early boyhood, I have seen in him signs of a peculiar
ability. He has always been passionately fond of
mechanics, and once, when a boy, was found trying to
construct a steam engine out of an old saucepan. I
have always hoped that he would enter actively into the
work of the road, and I believe he has now begun a
career that will prove both remarkable and glorious.
I believe that, by pursuing this course, he will be the
greatest railroad man of the age.”</p>

<p>“Where did he get this natural taste for the work,
Mr. Depew?” I asked.</p>

<p>“From his father, who did much the same work,
when he was young, that Cornelius Jr., is doing now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
But I believe Cornelius, Jr., takes an even greater
interest in the work. It is not a new duty with him,
but a natural ambition, and I believe that he would
have become a railroad man even if he were the son of
the poorest parents in the land. He is fitted by nature
for such a career.</p>

<p>“His progress has so far been very satisfactory in
every way. He has a genius for mastering details, and
has already learned the construction of a locomotive.
He has an inventive faculty, too, and has prepared
plans for a locomotive that will achieve greater speed
with smaller expenditure of coal. He expects to devote
the next few years to mastering every department
of railroad business, and he will eventually be competent
to fill almost any position on the road. He will
shovel coal and dig in the trenches, and polish engines.
He will lay rails and take them up, and learn how to
mend a cracked one. He will learn to detect uncertain
ground, too, and how to make it solid again. He
agrees with me that the way to make a workman respect
you is to work with him.”</p>


<h3>HE WILL MASTER EVERY DETAIL.</h3>

<p>“When he has finished his work on the road, he will
take his place in the offices here, and learn how the
system is administered. He will study the financial
department especially, which deals with expenditures
and receipts. This is, perhaps, the most important department
of all for him, but he will also study the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
freight and passenger departments, and learn why the
business increases and decreases, and the remedy for a
falling off. There are a hundred and one things to
learn, and he couldn’t learn them in any other way. It
will, of course, take a long time, perhaps fourteen or
fifteen years, but he has a great deal of grit and perseverance,
and I believe he will stick to it until he has
thoroughly mastered the business.</p>

<p>“He will, in all likelihood, be the next member of the
family to enter into the active management of the road.
His brothers and cousins may eventually go through
the same training, but Cornelius, Jr., is destined to be
the most active in the management. I may not live to
see it, but if his health holds out, and he is allowed to
pursue his own course, he will perpetuate the name and
fame of the Vanderbilts for another century.”</p>

<p>“He is a chip of the old block, indeed,” said another
friend of the Vanderbilt family, “and his industry
brings to mind the push and energy of the first Cornelius
Vanderbilt in the early part of his career. The
Commodore was never ashamed of any kind of honest
work, and Cornelius is not. He will always be a
worker, and his success in life is therefore assured,
whether his father disinherits him or not. It is not
believed, however, that Cornelius Vanderbilt will deprive
his son of his fair share in the estate. On the
contrary, however strong the feeling of displeasure the
father may have entertained toward Cornelius, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
thought by friends of the family that he will treat his
son and namesake fairly and even liberally.”</p>


<h3>WORKING AS A MACHINIST.</h3>

<p>Young Cornelius, in his work as a machinist and
office clerk, presents an example which other sons of
millionaires could follow with profit. He is not alone,
however, among young men of his class in training for
a useful life. One of New York’s richest young men
is said to be not only a worker, but an authority on
mechanics, and is able both to roll up his shirt-sleeves
and go to the bench, and to describe in the minutest
detail the work on which he is engaged. His ability in
the mechanical line would probably have won wealth
and success for him, even had he not been born to a
vast fortune. At the same time, the course of the next
in succession to the control of the Vanderbilt millions,
in entering upon an education in skilled labor as a common
workingman, is an excellent assurance that the
family stock is not degenerating, and that its interests
are in trustworthy hands.</p>

<p>The ambition of Commodore Vanderbilt to establish
and perpetuate a great railway empire seems likely to
be fulfilled, so far as the present and the rising generation
of the Vanderbilts are concerned. It is the most
remarkable experiment of the kind since the beginning
of the American republic.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Messenger Boy’s Zeal Lifts Him
to the Head of the World’s
Greatest Telegraph System.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>WHEN romance can be added to hard facts in
telling the life-story of a man, such a narrative
becomes more pointed and interesting
than the rarest dreams of a fictionist; therefore,
the true story of a man who has made himself
cannot fail to be instructive as well as interesting. No
other man in the United States, to-day, can look back
on a more remarkable career than that of Colonel Robert
C. Clowry, president of the Western Union Telegraph
Company. Mr. Clowry was delivering messages
for that company in 1852, with but one object in view,—to
hold his position. He is the busiest man, perhaps,
in America to-day, and has little time to spend
with an interviewer. He dislikes the notoriety that the
world gives to men who fight and win, but the story of
such a man is of more than passing interest. It is an
important, valuable, uplifting factor in the great compound
that makes America. It belongs to the people.
It is for their use to profit by, and, with this one condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
impressed on Mr. Clowry, he agreed to tell what
he knows about himself.</p>

<p>“I began my telegraph career on April 4, 1852,” he
said. “I shall never forget the day. I walked into the
office of Judge Caton’s old Illinois and Mississippi
Telegraph Company, at Joliet, Illinois, and told the
operator that I had come to learn the business. I can
see the rickety building now, and the surprised expression
on the operator’s face when he looked at me.</p>


<h3>HE WAS SO POOR HE HAD TO DO HIS OWN COOKING.</h3>

<p>“I had been living with my mother on a farm in Will
county, not far from Joliet, and, having reached the
age of fifteen, I thought it time to start out in the
world for myself. Ever since I first heard of the telegraph,
I was fascinated with its workings, and at that
time my chief ambition was to be able to send a message
over the wires.</p>

<p>“‘What kind of work do you want to do?’ the operator
asked me. I replied that I didn’t suppose I was
capable of doing anything but carry messages. ‘Well,’
he said, ‘we don’t pay boys anything the first six
months; but, if you want to work, you will have a
chance to learn the business. When you’re in the office
you can easily pick up the knack of operating the keys,
and, eventually, you’ll get an office of your own.’</p>

<p>“I hadn’t expected to earn any money at first, so I
told him I was ready to begin at once. That was the
beginning of my experience in the telegraph business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, if you received no money for six months, how
did you live in Joliet during that time?” I asked Colonel
Clowry.</p>

<p>“I was able to earn money by doing various odd jobs
around town, and of course my expenses were very
low. For a while I used to get my own meals. I had
learned to do plain cooking at home, and it was no
hardship for me to fry an egg or broil a piece of steak.
Joliet was a very small town in 1853, and I had never
been accustomed to luxuries living at home. I had to
work long hours at the office. I was the only messenger,
and had all the work to do, so I hardly had
time to be homesick. After my life on the farm, Joliet
was a regular metropolis in my eyes and I found much
to interest me. Of course, I was discouraged at times.
I was very young to be away from home and dependent
on my own resources, and it was only natural that I
should occasionally get the blues. But for the most
part I was wrapped up in my work and occupied with
ambitious plans for the future.”</p>

<p>“Were you able to learn telegraphy in a short time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it seemed to come natural to me. I always
liked mechanics and didn’t rest until I knew the function
of every key and lever connected with the instruments
in the office. Within two months, I was able to
send and receive a message, and in four months I was
quite as expert as the regular operator. He was surprised
at the readiness with which I learned, and remarked
one day that I wouldn’t remain a messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
long. This encouraged me, of course, but I had no idea
how soon I should be given an office of my own.</p>

<p>“I had various unpleasant experiences as a messenger.
I learned that, no matter how zealous I was in
my work, it was impossible to please everybody, and I
was frequently accused of loitering when in reality I
had hurried as much as possible. The telegraph was a
new institution in those days, and people were always
doubtful of its success. They seemed actually surprised
when a message was delivered without delay.”</p>


<h3>IT IS WELL TO KNOW WHAT MEN HAVE ACCOMPLISHED.</h3>

<p>“In the beginning I was discouraged every time a
man scolded me and found fault, but after a time I
realized that it was foolish to be worried over trifles.
I was doing my very best and knew that my services
were appreciated by the officials over me. When I had
been working six months as a messenger, I was delighted,
one day, by the information that the office at
Lockport, Illinois, was vacant, and that I was to be
placed in charge. I was not yet sixteen years old, but
most people took me to be nineteen or twenty, and the
superintendent said that age shouldn’t count against
ability. Lockport is in the same county as Joliet, so I
was stationed near home, and my mother was delighted
at the progress I had made.”</p>

<p>“At such an age you must have felt the responsibility
of having the entire office in your charge.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Colonel Clowry, “I think I did. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
my constant endeavor to appear older than sixteen,
because I felt that business men might not have confidence
in my ability if they knew I was so very young.
I was fortunate in my work. Everything progressed
favorably under my management, and, as the business
rapidly increased, the superintendent was pleased with
my work.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the company would nowadays employ
a boy of sixteen as manager?”</p>

<p>“That’s a difficult question to answer,” said Colonel
Clowry. “I think, if the boy were capable and earnest,
he would be given such a position. Merit is as quickly
rewarded to-day as ever.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you did not stay long at Lockport?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have been satisfied to stay there long.
It was my ambition to be manager of a more important
office, and I tried to prove myself worthy of a better
position. I took advantage of every opportunity to improve
my education. I read every book which could
give me any knowledge of telegraphy and electricity,
and was especially interested in biography, travel, history,
and geography. I was obliged to remain at the
office until late in the evening, but often I sat up until
after midnight, reading and studying. I think it is
helpful for every boy to know what great and successful
men have really accomplished. Among my favorite
books were the journals of Lewis and Clark on their
expedition across the continent in 1804, and, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was discouraged or disheartened, it cheered me to remember
the vicissitudes encountered by them.”</p>


<h3>HE TRIED TO DO MORE THAN HE WAS PAID TO DO.</h3>

<p>“I always endeavored, while at Lockport, and in
every other position I have filled, to perform more service
than that which was allotted to me and to watch
my employer’s interests at all times, regardless of stipulated
hours. It is a great mistake for a young man to
think that his efforts to be efficient and to perform
more work than is set apart for him will not be noticed
by his employers or superior officers. The appreciation
of such services may seem tardy, but it is almost sure to
come, and, in my case, it came very soon. After I had
served at Lockport for a few months, I was transferred
to Springfield, Illinois, which is a more important station.
I was not seventeen when I began my work
there, but I felt myself to be quite an experienced person
in the business, and capable of caring for almost
any office. On account of my night study I had a
thorough knowledge of the principles of telegraphy,
and my practice as an operator had given me the necessary
technical qualifications.</p>

<p>“Operators didn’t receive as much then as they do
now, but living expenses were low. When I went to
Lockport, I believe that I was paid about a dollar a
day, and at Springfield my wages were somewhat
higher. In 1854, two years after I first began to carry
messages, I was sent to St. Louis, as the company’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
chief operator, and of course that was a considerable
promotion. I remained in that position until 1858,
when I became superintendent of the St. Louis and
Missouri River Telegraph Company, which was constructing
many new lines in the border region. The
company was not very rich, but it was very necessary
that its system should be extended. It occurred to me
that the citizens of the border towns ought to be willing
to pay something to have the convenience of the telegraph;
so, when the line was constructed to Kansas
City, I raised three thousand dollars in Leavenworth
to extend it to that place, and two thousand dollars in
Atchinson to have it built to that city from Leavenworth.
In this way we accomplished what the company
was financially unable to do.</p>


<h3>THERE ARE AS GOOD CHANCES IN THE WORLD TO-DAY.</h3>

<p>“When the Civil War began, I offered my services
to the government, and was placed in charge of the
military telegraph in the Department of Arkansas.
Missouri and Kansas were subsequently added to my
territory. I served through the war, and, at its close,
when I was twenty-seven years old, I became a district
superintendent for the Western Union Telegraph Company
in the southwest. I have been with this company
ever since, having served in various capacities in
St. Louis and Chicago. This is my fiftieth year in the
telegraph business, and I became president of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Western Union just fifty years to a month after I first
entered the Joliet office and asked for work.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that a young man starting in commercial
life to-day has as good a chance to rise as one had
fifty years ago?” Colonel Clowry was asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; in my opinion the chances of success
in commercial business, for the right sort of young
men, have never before been so good as they are at the
present time, provided that the young men are well
educated, honest, industrious, and faithful, and not
handicapped by mental or physical defects.”</p>

<p>“But you had only a common-school education, Colonel
Clowry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that is quite sufficient in business if it is
supplemented by some technical training. I have always
thought that a full university course has a tendency to
unfit young men for the rough struggles incident to
the small beginnings of a commercial business career.
It is advisable for boys to enter business early in life,
so that they may be moulded to their work, and be in
line for promotion when opportunities present themselves.
Boys have an idea nowadays that they can
leave college and immediately fill important positions
in business life. There was never a greater mistake.
Although I was in charge of an office six months after
beginning work, it has taken fifty years to reach my
present position.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Enthusiasm for Railroading Makes
a Section Hand Head of the
Metropolitan System.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>SOME time ago New York learned with interest
and some astonishment that the head of its
greatest transportation system, Herbert H. Vreeland,
had received from several of his associates,
as individuals, a “valentine” present of $100,000, in
recognition of his superb management of their properties.
Many New Yorkers then learned, for the first
time, what railroad experts throughout the country
had long known, that the transportation of a million
people a day in New York’s busy streets, without serious
friction or public annoyance, is not a matter of
chance, but is the result of perhaps the most perfect
traffic organization ever created, at the head of which
is a man, quiet, forceful, able, with the ability of a
great general,—a master, and, at the same time a friend
of men,—himself one for whom, in the judgment of his
associates, almost any career is possible.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago Mr. Vreeland, then a lad thirteen
years old, was, to use his own humorous, reminiscent
phrase, “h’isting ice” on the Hudson River, one of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
gang of eighteen or twenty men and boys filling the ice
carts for retail city delivery. A picture just brought
to light shows him among the force lined up to be
photographed, as a tall, loosely built, hatchet-faced lad
in working garb, with a fragment of a smile on his
face, as if he could appreciate the contrast of the boy of
that day with the man of the future.</p>

<p>How do these things happen? What was the divine
spark in this boy’s brain and heart that should lift him
out of the crowd of the commonplace to the position
of responsibility and influence in the world which he
now occupies? If my readers could have been present
at the interview kindly granted by Mr. Vreeland and
could have heard him recalling his early life and its
many struggles and disappointments with a smile that
was often near a tear, they would have gone away feeling
that nothing is impossible to him who dares, and,
above all else, who <i>works</i>, and they would have derived
inspiration far greater than can possibly be given in
these written words.</p>


<h3>HE INHERITED A TASTE FOR HARD WORK.</h3>

<p>The desire to work was hereditary with Mr. Vreeland.
His father incurred the displeasure of his own
father and family, who were people of large means, by
refusing to lead a life of gentlemanly idleness, and deciding,
instead, to enter the ministry. The boy Herbert
was the youngest son in a family of several children,
each of whom in turn helped to support the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mother and younger members after the death of the
father. At ten years of age, in his passionate desire to
do <i>something</i>, he drove a grocery wagon in Jersey
City, to which his family had moved from his birth-place
in Glen, New York, and, as before said, at thirteen
years of age, he was hard at work in an ice business,
of which an elder brother was superintendent.</p>

<p>“I first entered the railroad business in 1875,” said
Mr. Vreeland, “shoveling gravel on one of the Long
Island Railroad Company’s night construction trains.
Though this position was certainly humble enough, it
was a great thing to me then to feel myself a railroad
man, with all that that term implied; and, when, after
a few months’ trial, I was given the job of inspecting
ties and roadbed at a dollar a day, I felt that I was well
on the road to the presidency.</p>

<p>“One day the superintendent asked the boss if he
could give him a reliable man to replace a switchman
who had just made a blunder leading to a collision,
and had been discharged. The reply was: ‘Well, I’ve
got a man here named Vreeland, who will do exactly
what you tell him to.’ They called me up, and, after a
few short, sharp questions from the train-master, I
went down to the dreary and desolate marsh near
Bushwick, Long Island, and took charge of a switch.
For a few days I had to camp out near that switch, in
any way that might happen, but finally the officers
made up their minds that they could afford me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
luxury of a two-by-four flag house with a stove in it,
and I settled down for more railroading.”</p>


<h3>HE LOVED HIS WORK.</h3>

<p>“The Bushwick station was not far away, and one
of the company’s division headquarters was there. I
soon made the acquaintance of all the officials around
that station, and got into their good graces by offering
to help them out in their clerical work at any and all
times when I was off duty. It was a godsend to them,
and exactly what I wanted, for I had determined to
get into the inside of the railroad business from bottom
to top. Many’s the time I have worked till eleven or
twelve o’clock at night in that little station, figuring
out train receipts and expenses, engine cost and duty,
and freight and passenger statistics of all kinds; and,
as a result of this work, I quickly acquired a grasp of
railroad details in all stages, which few managers possess,
for, in one way and another, I got into and through
every branch of the business.</p>

<p>“My Bushwick switch was a temporary one, put in
for construction purposes only, and, after some months’
use, was discontinued, and I was discharged. This
did not suit me at all, and I went to one of the officials
of the road and told him that I wanted to remain with
the Long Island Railroad Company in any capacity
whatsoever, and would be obliged to him if he would
give me a job. He said, at first, that he hadn’t a thing
for me to do, but finally added, as if he was ashamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to suggest it, that, if I had a mind to go down on
another division and sweep out and dust cars, I might
do it. I instantly accepted, and thereby learned the
details of another important railroad department.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon they made me brakeman on an early
morning train to Hempstead, and then I found that I
was worth to the world, after two years of railroad
training, just forty dollars a month, plus a perquisite
or two obtained from running a card-table department
in the smoking-cars. I remember that I paid eighteen
dollars of my munificent salary for board and lodging,
sent twenty dollars home for the support of my mother
and sister, and had two dollars a month and the aforesaid
perquisites left for ‘luxuries.’”</p>


<h3>A NICKNAME THAT BECAME A REAL TITLE.</h3>

<p>“It was at about this time, thus early in my career,
that I first came to be known as ‘President Vreeland.’
An old codger upon the railroad, in talking to me one
day, said, in a bantering way: ‘Well, I suppose you
think your fortune is made, now you have become a
brakeman, but let me tell you what will happen. You
will be a brakeman about four or five years, and then
they will make you a conductor, at about one hundred
dollars a month, and there you will stick all your life,
if you don’t get discharged.’ I responded, rather
angrily, ‘Do you suppose I am going to be satisfied
with remaining a conductor? I mean to be president
of a railroad,’ ‘Ho, ho, ho!’ laughed the man. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
told the story around, and many a time thereafter the
boys slyly placed the word ‘President’ before my name
on official instructions and packages sent to me.</p>

<p>“A conductor on one of the regular trains quarreled
one morning with the superintendent, and was discharged.
I was sent for and told to take out that
train. This was jumping me over the heads of many
of the older brakemen, and, as a consequence, all the
brakemen on that train quit. Others were secured,
however, and I ran the train regularly for a good many
months.</p>

<p>“Then came an accident one day, for which the engineer
and I were jointly responsible. We admitted our
responsibility, and were discharged. I went again to
the superintendent, however, and, upon a strong plea
to be retained in the service, he sent me back to the
ranks among the brakemen. I had no complaint to
make, but accepted the consequence of my mistake.</p>

<p>“Soon after this, the control of the road passed into
other hands. Many were discharged, and I was daily
expecting my own ‘blue envelope.’ One day I was detailed
to act as brakeman on a special which was to
convey the president and directors of the road, with
invited guests, on a trip over the lines. By that time I
had learned the Long Island Railroad in all its branches
pretty well, and, in the course of the trip, was called
upon to answer a great many questions. The next day
I received word that the superintendent wanted to see
me. My heart sank within me, for summons of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
kind were ominous in those days, but I duly presented
myself at the office and was asked, ‘Are you the good-looking
brakeman who was on the special yesterday
who shows his teeth when he smiles?’ I modestly replied
that I was certainly on the special yesterday, and
I may possibly have partly confirmed the rest of the
identification by a smile, for the superintendent, without
further questioning, said: ‘The president wants to
see you upstairs.’</p>

<p>“I went up, and in due time was shown into the
presence of the great man, who eyed me closely for a
minute or two, and then asked me abruptly what I was
doing. I told him I was braking Number Seventeen.
He said: ‘Take this letter to your superintendent. It
contains a request that he relieve you from duty, and
put somebody else in your place. After he has done so,
come back here.’”</p>


<h3>AN IMPORTANT MISSION WELL PERFORMED.</h3>

<p>“All this I did, and, on my return to the president,
he said, ‘Take this letter at once to Admiral Peyron, of
the French fleet (then lying in the harbor on a visit of
courtesy to this country), and this to General Hancock,
on Governor’s Island. They contain invitations
to each to dine with me to-morrow night at home in
Garden City with their staffs. Get their answers, and,
if they are ”yes,“ return at once to New York, charter
a steamer, call for them to-morrow afternoon, land
them at Long Island City, arrange for a special train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
from Long Island City to Garden City, take them
there, and return them after the banquet. I leave
everything in your hands. Good day.’</p>

<p>“I suppose this might be considered a rather large
job for a common brakeman, but I managed to get
through with it without disgracing myself, and apparently
to the satisfaction of all concerned. For some
time thereafter, I was the president’s special emissary
on similar matters connected with the general conduct
of the business, and while I did not, perhaps, learn so
very much about railroading proper, was put in positions
where I learned to take responsibility and came
to have confidence in myself.</p>

<p>“The control of the Long Island Railroad again
changed hands, and I was again ‘let out,’ this time for
good, so far as that particular road was concerned,—except
that, within the last two or three years, I have
renewed my acquaintance with it through being commissioned
by a banking syndicate in New York City
to make an expert examination of its plant and equipment
as a preliminary to reorganization.</p>

<p>“This was in 1881, or about that time, and I soon
secured a position as conductor on the New York and
Northern Railroad, a little line running from One
Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street, New York City, to
Yonkers. Not to go into tedious detail regarding my
experience there, I may say in brief that in course of
time, I practically ‘ran the road.’ After some years, it
changed hands (a thing which railways, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
small ones, often do, and always to the great discomposure
of the employees), and the new owners, including
William C. Whitney, Daniel S. Lamont, Captain
R. Somers Hayes and others, went over the road one
day on a special train to visit the property. As I have
said, I was then practically running the road, owing to
the fact that the man who held the position as general
manager was not a railroad man and relied upon me to
handle all details, but my actual position was only
that of train-master. I accompanied the party, and
knowing the road thoroughly, not only physically but
also statistically, was able to answer all the questions
which they raised. This was the first time I had met
Mr. Whitney, and I judge that I made a somewhat
favorable impression upon him, for not long after that I
was created general manager of the road.”</p>


<h3>HOW HE WAS ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY OF HIS
COMPANY.</h3>

<p>“A few months later, I received this telegram:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">“‘<span class="smcap">H. H. Vreeland.</span></p>

<p>“‘Meet me at Broadway and Seventh Avenue office
at two o’clock to-day.</p>

<p class='sig'>
“<span class="smcap">William C. Whitney.</span>’<br />
</p></div>

<p>“I had to take a special engine to do this, but arrived
at two o’clock at the office of the Houston Street, West
Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad Company, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
then knew, in an indistinct sort of way, owned a small
horse railway in the heart of New York. After finding
that Mr. Whitney was out at lunch, I kicked my heels
for a few minutes outside the gate, and then inquired
of a man who was seated inside in an exceedingly comfortable
chair, when Mr. Whitney and his party were
expected, saying, also, that my name was Vreeland,
and I had an appointment at two. He replied: ‘Oh,
are you Mr. Vreeland? Well, here is a letter for you.
Mr. Whitney expected to be here at two o’clock, but is
a little late.’ I took my letter and sat down again
outside, thinking that it might possibly contain an appointment
for another hour. It was, however, an appointment
of quite a different character. It read as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class='unindent'>“‘<span class="smcap">Mr. H. H. Vreeland.</span></p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—At a meeting of the stockholders of
the Houston Street, West Street and Pavonia Ferry
Railroad Company, held this day, you were unanimously
elected a director of the company.</p>

<p>“‘At a subsequent meeting of the directors, you were
unanimously elected president and general manager,
your duties to commence immediately.</p>

<p class='sig'>
“‘Yours truly, &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   <span class="smcap">C. E. Warren</span>, Secretary.’<br />
</p></div>

<p>“By the time I had recovered from my surprise at
learning that I was no longer a steam-railroad, but a
street-railroad man, Mr. Whitney and other directors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
came in, and, after spending about five minutes in introductions,
they took up their hats and left, saying,
simply, ‘Well, Vreeland, you are president; now run
the road.’ I then set out to learn what kind of a toy
railway it was that had come into my charge.”</p>


<h3>HIGH-PRICED MEN ARE IN DEMAND.</h3>

<p>Mr. Vreeland was asked the secret of successfully
managing a street-railway system of this sort.</p>

<p>“High-priced men,” he unhesitatingly replied. “High-priced
men, and one-man power in all departments.
Ten-thousand-dollar-a-year men are what I want,—one
of these rather than five two-thousand-dollar-a-year
men.”</p>

<p>“I began at the bottom and worked up. I think that
is always the way for a young man to do, as soon as
he has decided upon his career. I was fitted for the
railroad business, and it didn’t take me long to decide
just what I wanted to be. I think much of my progress
was due to my early beginning. I think an early beginning
means a great deal in after life.</p>

<p>“I have always been glad that I chose the business
I did. I have never had any reason to regret having
done so. Of course, when I was very young, I had
discontented moments, like almost every other youth,
but I overcame them, and stayed with the railroad. I
believe that everyone should overcome those passing
fancies, instead of yielding to them. Too many young
fellows, just starting out, go from one thing to another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
never satisfied, and consequently never making any
progress. I think the faculty for ‘sticking’ is one of
the most valuable a young man can have. When an
employer hires a man, he likes to feel that he won’t be
wasting his time in teaching him the business. He likes
to feel that the man will remain with him, and be a real
help, instead of leaving at the first opportunity.”</p>

<p>The rest of the history is well known to the people
of New York, and to experts in street railroading
throughout the country. The “Whitney syndicate,”
so-called, was then in possession of a few only out of
some twenty or more street railway properties in New
York City, the Broadway line, however, being one of
these, and by far the most valuable. With the immense
financial resources of Messrs. Whitney, Widener, Elkins,
and their associates, nearly all the other properties
were added to the original lines owned by the syndicate,
and with the magnificent organizing and executive
ability of Mr. Vreeland, there has been built up in New
York a street railway system which, while including
less than two hundred and fifty miles of track, is actually
carrying more than one-half as many passengers
each year as are being carried by all the steam railroads
of the United States together.</p>

<h2 class="num">XIV<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Factory Boy’s Purpose to Improve
Labor Makes Him a Great
Leader.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>“TO reduce the burdens of the overworked
and find employment for the workless
workers,” as expressed in his own words,
is the life-work of Samuel Gompers.
This single aim has been the wellspring of the manifold
activities, excitements, vicissitudes, and achievements
of a remarkable career. Nearly forty years ago, when
Samuel Gompers, a boy of ten, worked fourteen hours
a day in a shop in London, the hardships of the workingman
made an impression on his childish mind, and
this impression, and vague ideas that followed it, were
the beginnings of his life purpose,—a purpose that kept
growing and strengthening during twenty-six years at
the cigarmaker’s bench, and finally raised him to the
position of foremost representative in America of the
interests of labor.</p>

<p>Being president of the American Federation of
Labor, whose headquarters are in Washington, Mr.
Gompers now lives in that city, but not long ago he
was in New York as one of the distinguished speakers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
before a great mass meeting. The following night, in
an obscure hall on the “eastside” where a number of
his old friends and fellow-workers in the cigarmaker’s
trade had gathered to discuss their common interests,
I had my interview with him.</p>


<h3>LOOKS LIKE EDWIN FORREST.</h3>

<p>“He’s not here yet,” I was informed on my arrival;
“but come in and wait. When he comes, anybody will
point out Sam to you.” The room filled rapidly, and
at length there appeared in the doorway a small man
with a great head, covered with a luxuriant growth of
very black hair. His short, robust figure, his high
forehead, deep-set eyes, heavy mustache and short imperial
made him look strikingly like some of the portraits
of Edwin Forrest. He came in alone and attracted
no special attention, but I knew intuitively that it was
Samuel Gompers. With such easy and cordial salutations
as “Hello, Jack!” “How are you, Herman?” and
“Glad to see you, Mac!” he began to greet his old
friends, and they responded in the same spirit, almost
invariably addressing him as “Sam.” This did not imply
a lack of dignity on his part, for these were his old
shopmates,—men who had for years worked with him
at the same benches. They recognized each other as
fellow-workmen, with no difference between them, and,
indeed, the only difference was that Sam Gompers had
thought much and seen much in his mental vision as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sat at the mechanical work of cutting and rolling
tobacco leaves, while the others had seen only their
own environment and machine-like toil. But this difference
has made one a leading citizen of the Republic,
while his mates have remained humble cigarmakers,
looking to Mr. Gompers as their champion and friend.</p>

<p>“It was just at such meetings as you see here to-night,”
Mr. Gompers said to me later in the evening,
“that I began to try to do something in behalf of the
workingmen. Even when a small boy in London, and
working pretty hard for the child I was, I used to
attend some of the gatherings of workingmen, and I
remember how I was stirred by the excitement and
enthusiasm when the question of recognizing the Confederate
States was before the government and there
were great meetings of the working classes to show the
feeling of British workmen against slavery of any sort.
I had already vaguely begun to feel that there was
more than one kind of slavery, and that the workingmen
who had protested so vigorously against slaves in
America could hardly call themselves free men. I
knew little of the matter; I only knew that my own life
was hard, while that of many other children was easy.”</p>


<h3>HE WORKED IN A FACTORY AT TEN.</h3>

<p>“When I was ten, I had been put in a factory to
learn shoemaking, but a few months afterward was
apprenticed to a man in my father’s trade,—that of a
cigarmaker. I went to school at night, but it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
very meagre foundation for an education that I got
this way, and I have been trying ever since to make
up for it by reading and study. My lack of early opportunity
to learn and develop normally, with schooling
and much recreation, as a boy should, has always
been a great drawback to me, but it has made me zealous
in the cause of keeping the children of the workers
out of the workshops and giving them a fair education.
College training is not necessary for success in any but
scholastic pursuits, but boys must certainly know the
rudiments.”</p>


<h3>THE LATER ARISTOCRACY.</h3>

<p>“Times were bad in London when I was a child there.
Gangs of workmen used to parade the streets, singing
mournfully, ‘We have no work to do!’ This condition
led my father to immigrate to this country, in 1863,
when I was thirteen. I continued my trade of cigarmaker
in New York, and joined the ‘Cigarmakers’
International Union’ when it was organized, in 1864.
It now has thirty thousand members, but mine is the
longest continued membership; my due card is No. 1.
This was the first labor organization I belonged to. I
attended its meetings and got into the habit of studying
and thinking about labor matters and the many changes
in the workingman’s condition that would be beneficial
to himself and to the commonwealth.</p>

<p>“I began to realize that, in the struggles of the ages,
lords and nobles have lost their gold lace and velvet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but that they survive as the economic lords of the
means of life, and that their aggressions must be opposed
by combinations of labor—by trade unions. I
began to appreciate the true dignity of labor and the
importance to the state of fair conditions for workingmen.
The older I grew, the more essential seemed the
strong organization of labor. I felt what Wendell
Phillips expressed in these words: ‘I rejoice at every
effort workingmen make to organize. I hail the labor
movement. It is my only hope for democracy. Organize
and stand together. Let the nation hear a
united demand from the laboring voice.’</p>


<h3>THE NEED OF ORGANIZED LABOR.</h3>

<p>“Of course the idea of organized labor is a very old
one. Trade unions have been in existence since the
Middle Ages, but what they needed in this country was
more cohesive strength. There were a great number of
separate unions and some general organizations, but
they were not strong enough. A new plan was needed,
and we published a call which resulted in a convention
at Pittsburg, in 1881, at which the American Federation
of Labor was formed. Most of the delegates to
that convention were strongly opposed to our project
for an organization on broader lines than had been
before attempted, but we carried the point, and at
present the Federation has six hundred and fifty
thousand members.”</p>

<p>It is a matter of history that Samuel Gompers was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the founder of the American Federation of Labor. The
first impulse came from him. While sitting at his
bench in New York rolling cigars, he conceived the
plan that has made the Federation the largest and most
important and useful labor organization that has ever
existed.</p>


<h3>HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERATION.</h3>

<p>Mr. Gompers declined the presidency at the first
convention, but he was obliged to accept it at the
second great gathering, held in Cleveland, in 1882.
For some time after his election he remained at work
at his trade, but the growing number and importance
of his duties at length made it necessary for him to
devote all his time to the Federation, which he does
for a salary that many clerks would scoff at. Mr.
Gompers has received offers for nominations to congress
from both the Republican and Democratic parties
in his New York district, and has been asked by
several presidents of the United States to accept important
and highly salaried offices, but he has declined
them all, feeling that his present position gives him
greater opportunities of usefulness to the workingman.</p>

<p>The laws whose place on the statute books are due
to the efforts of Mr. Gompers make a long list. They
include sanitary inspection for factories, mills, mines,
etc., the age limit law, employers’ liabilities for damages
to life and limb, wage-lien laws, uniform car-coupling
laws, anti-sweatshop legislation, the anti-conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
law, the state-board-of-arbitration law, laws restricting
the hours of labor, and the enactment making
the first Monday in September a holiday.</p>


<h3>FOR THE EIGHT-HOUR WORKDAY.</h3>

<p>“At present,” said Mr. Gompers, “one of our chief
slogans is,—‘An Eight-Hour Workday!’ There is
more in this than one might think at a first glance.
With a little leisure, the workingman has an opportunity
to read and cultivate his mind and devote himself
to his home and family. It makes him expand
intellectually and think more, and with this new life
come new desires. He wants to have his home more
comfortable than it has been. He wants a few books,
a few pictures, a little recreation for himself and family,
and for these things he makes outlays of money which
are very modest in individual cases, but which, in the
aggregate, amount to vast sums and have a stimulating
effect on all trades. This makes an increased demand
for labor. It has a tendency to raise wages and diminish
the number of the unemployed. These important
benefits to be derived from shorter hours of
labor constitute the reason why I am making an issue
of the eight-hour workday. We have already done
much and expect to do more. Yet you have no idea
how hard it sometimes is to procure the passage of a
measure. When the uniform car-coupling bill was
before the senate, the senators would run into the coat-room
to avoid voting, and I stood at the door in a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
frantic condition, sending my card to this senator and
that senator, and telling each that he simply must support
the measure. It was hard work, but we carried it
through.”</p>


<h3>STRIKES AS A LAST RESORT.</h3>

<p>Strikes are not favored by Mr. Gompers except
under certain circumstances and as a last resort. During
the great Chicago strike, the most intense pressure
was brought to bear upon him to issue an order calling
out all the workingmen in the country. It took high
moral courage to resist the many strenuous appeals,
but Samuel Gompers possessed this courage and the
country was saved from an experience which might
have proved most calamitous.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe in arbitration,” said Mr. Gompers,
“but to arbitrate, the power must be equal, or nearly
so, on both sides; therefore labor must be strongly
organized.”</p>

<p>I asked him to what he attributed his success in his
life-work.</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered slowly, “I learned both to think
and to act, and to feel strongly enough on these great
questions of labor to be willing to sacrifice my personal
convenience for my aims. I have felt great devotion
to the common cause of the manual workers, and
I can say nothing better to young men than,—‘Be
devoted to your work.’”</p>

<p>When I asked a very intelligent workingman why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Samuel Gompers is so highly respected by the workers,
he replied:—</p>

<p>“Why, because,—because he’s Sam Gompers,—but
that doesn’t explain much, does it? Well, I will say
because he has done more for labor than any other man
in this country, because we can trust him down to the
ground, and because he’s in his work heart and soul.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Puny Boy, by Physical Culture,
Becomes the Most Vigorous of
American Presidents.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THE way to study a man, I find, is at close range,
when he is not on the platform or under the
limelight. Better than any other is his vacation
time, when the armor has been laid aside
and the man himself stands forth. My card of introduction
proved a ready passport to the country seat of
Theodore Roosevelt, near Oyster Bay, Long Island.
As I drove up, one bright July morning, the shore of
this sequestered inlet was framed in a background of
heavy green. No painter could do justice to the mirrored
loveliness of the water, or the graceful line of
sailboats lazily floating over it. The beach was a silver
mat in an emerald frame, and every tree on the opposite
shore was inverted in the clear depths. The Roosevelt
house stands on a hill overlooking a magnificent
view of Long Island Sound. It is three miles away
from the railway station, just the sort of place one
would choose for complete rest. The dreamy beauty
of the scene was conducive to indolence, and so, sure
enough, I found Mr. Roosevelt in outing attire, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by his children and entering with zest into
their out-door sports.</p>

<p>Little Theodore was prancing up and down the road
on his favorite black pony, a genuine rough rider in
horsemanship, brown as a berry, and an unmistakable
cadet of the Roosevelt house. The president’s war-horse,
“Texas,” whose right ear was clipped by a
Spanish “Mauser,” was out for an airing. Over the
veranda flared a pair of great antlers, a trophy of the
chase, while in the big reception hall were other antlers.
The sword worn by Colonel Roosevelt in Cuba has
found a resting-place across the mantel mirror, its
leathern strap all ready to be buckled on again should
a military emergency arise. The overcoat is there, too,
with the hat and boots.</p>

<p>I found him averse to politics as a topic for
discussion, but I hinted that I would be pleased to
quote his views on young men in politics,—their
chances and their duties.</p>


<h3>YOUNG MEN IN POLITICS.</h3>

<p>“That opens up,” said he, as he smiled graciously,
“such a vista of human thought that I know you will
excuse me from its contemplation this hot weather.”</p>

<p>The shade of the veranda where we sat was deliciously
somnolent, and I was beginning to regret my
question when the president relented for a moment.</p>

<p>“You know I have always advocated an earnest, intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
study of political subjects by young men. Our
American politics offer a clean, wholesome field, after
all is said and done, for the young man of character
and ability; but never should one enter politics for a
living.”</p>

<p>“Now, we know that you approve of college education
for boys, but want your own words about it.”</p>

<p>“It depends somewhat on the boy. I don’t believe
in every boy going to college.”</p>

<p>“But do you not think it makes them less practical
than they would be if they grew up in business pursuits?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. The best kind of college graduates are
the most practical, and they are becoming more numerous
every year. Don’t you think I’m practical?”</p>

<p>“Do you think the boys in towns like this have as
good a chance for success in life as those who live in
large cities?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, and often better chances. I have always
been glad to have been raised in the country. Of course
it is often a good thing for a boy to go to the city when
he is grown. He sometimes does better there than in
a small place; not always, though. It depends upon
the boy.”</p>


<h3>OPPORTUNITIES AND TALENTS.</h3>

<p>“Are you a believer in opportunity, Mr. Roosevelt?”</p>

<p>“To a certain extent. Many of the great changes in
our lives can be traced to small things, a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
acquaintance, an accident, or some little happening. A
time comes to every man when he must do a thing or
miss a great benefit. If the man does it, all is well. If
not, it isn’t likely that he will have the chance again.
You can call that opportunity if you wish, but it is
foresight that leads a man to take advantage of the
condition of things. Foresight is a most valuable thing
to have.”</p>

<p>“Some men,” I remarked, after a time, “have a talent
for working themselves, while others have a talent for
setting others to work. Which is the more valuable?”</p>

<p>“I think a man ought to have both. If he can’t, I
think he ought to be able to work himself. The ability
to work hard is, perhaps, the most valuable aid to success.
One can’t have much success without it.”</p>

<p>“They say it isn’t a good thing for a young man to
have too many talents, Mr. Roosevelt. Is it true?”</p>

<p>“That’s very hard to answer. I have managed to do
many different things in a lifetime. I might have done
better by doing only one. Still, that is another thing
that depends very much upon the young man, and his
capabilities.”</p>

<p>“I know you must believe in recreation for people
who are working, since you are yourself indulging in
it now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, one must have some change. A man who
has no outdoor exercise is likely to wear himself out in
short order. I love to be out of doors. I always have,
and that is one thing that has helped me to do some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
things that I have. I go out for a time every day
when I am here at home. I enjoy being in the open
air.”</p>

<p>“I know you think that the young man of to-day has
a better chance to make a success in life than those
who lived twenty-five years ago.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. The young man of to-day has greater
opportunities for advancing himself and achieving a
real success than any men have ever had before. Everything
offers better chances, and all a boy needs is education
enough to appreciate them when they are here.
That is one of the chief values of a good education. It
aids a young man in many things that would be invisible
to the uneducated fellow. It helps him to weigh
things in his mind before deciding what to do. It is
mind-training that we need. The power to think is
almost absolutely necessary to success. Without it, a
man is sure to be unequal to the great struggle for
supremacy that is going on constantly in certain professions
and lines of business.”</p>

<p>In a contributed article President Roosevelt gave
his views of what constitutes good citizenship. An
extract from this article is given herewith:</p>


<h3>THE CITIZENSHIP THAT COUNTS.</h3>

<p>“After honesty as the foundation of the citizenship
that counts, in business or in politics, must come courage.
You must have courage not only in battle, but
also in civic life. We need physical and we need moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
courage. Neither is enough by itself. You need moral
courage. Many a man has been brave physically who
has flinched morally. You must feel in you a fiery
wrath against evil. When you see a wrong, instead of
feeling shocked and hurt, and a desire to go home, and
a wish that right prevailed, you should go out and fight
until that wrong is overcome. You must feel ashamed
if you do not stand up for the right as you see it;
ashamed if you lead a soft and easy life and fail to do
your duty. You must have courage. If you do not,
the honesty is of no avail.</p>

<p>“But honesty and courage, while indispensable, are
not enough for good citizenship. I do not care how
brave and honest a man is; if he is a fool, he is not
worth knocking on the head. In addition to courage
and honesty, you must have the saving quality of common
sense. One hundred and ten years ago, France
started to form a republic, and one of her noted men—an
exceedingly brilliant man, a scholar of exceptional
thought, the Abbe Sieyés,—undertook to draw up a
constitution. He drew up several constitutions, beautiful
documents; but they would not work. The French
national convention resolved in favor of liberty; and,
in the name of liberty, they beheaded every man who
did not think as they did. They resolved in favor of
fraternity, and beheaded those who objected to such a
brotherhood. They resolved in favor of equality, and
cut off the heads of those who rose above the general
level. They indulged in such hideous butcheries, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
name of liberty, equality, and fraternity, as to make
tyranny seem mild in comparison;—and all because
they lacked common sense, as well as morality.</p>

<p>“Two or three years before that, we, in America, had
a body of men gathered in a constitutional convention
to make a constitution. They assembled under the lead
of Washington, with Alexander Hamilton, Madison,
and many other eminent men. They did not draw up a
constitution in a week, as the brilliant Sieyés did, but
just one constitution, and that one worked. That was
the great point!</p>

<p>“It worked, primarily, because it was drawn up by
practical politicians,—by practical politicians who believed
in decency, as well as in common sense. If they
had been a set of excellent theorists, they would have
drawn up a constitution which would have commended
itself to other excellent theorists, but which would not
have worked. If they had been base, corrupt men,
mere opportunists, men who lacked elevating ideals,
dishonest, cowardly, they would have drawn up a document
that would not have worked at all. On the great
scale, the only practical politics is honest politics. The
makers of our constitution were practical politicians,
who were also sincere reformers, and as brave and upright
as they were sensible.”</p>


<h3>THE BOYHOOD OF ROOSEVELT.</h3>

<p>Nobody thought of calling Theodore Roosevelt
“Teddy,” when he was a boy. He was always known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
as “Tedie,”—pronounced as if written “Teedie.” But
several years before he went to Harvard, when he was
about fifteen years old, his mother thought that it was
high time that the baby name was replaced by something
more dignified, and so it was decided, in family
council, that he should be addressed as Theodore.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, family decisions of this kind are not
always respected at school or college, and, when young
Roosevelt became a freshman at Harvard, he was
promptly dubbed “Teddy” by his classmates. The
nickname stuck; he has been “Teddy” ever since to
his intimates, and to-day he is more generally known
under that title by seventy-six millions of people than
by any other. There is every reason to believe that he
enjoys the little informality, justly regarding it as a
tribute to his popularity.</p>

<p>When he was nine years of age, young Roosevelt
was taken abroad by his parents, and he made another
trip with them to Europe not long afterward, greatly
enjoying a voyage up the Nile. At seventeen he entered
Harvard, and promptly grew a pair of side-whiskers,
of which it may reasonably be supposed that
he was very proud. The side-whiskers resembled
those of Pendennis, as pictured by Thackeray. It goes
without saying that he soon became extremely popular
at college, where he acquitted himself fairly well in his
studies. Old classmates recall the fact that he had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
passion for animals and that he collected many queer
natural history specimens, which he kept in his room.</p>


<h3>WHERE HE GAINED STRENUOSITY.</h3>

<p>On the whole, it is rather surprising that Theodore
Roosevelt ever lived to grow up and become the President
of the United States. He was an exceedingly
delicate child, suffering such tortures with asthma that
on many occasions his father was obliged to harness
his four-in-hand in the middle of the night, take the
boy from his bed, and drive many miles, in order that
he might get his breath.</p>

<p>To my thinking, his inherent manliness, his independence
of thought and action, his firm determination to
do his duty as he sees it, found early expression in the
character of Theodore Roosevelt when, as a youth, in
search of health and strength, he went to the great
west. It is probable that, while yet a young man, he
was ambitiously inspired to do something out of the
ordinary, and was shrewd enough to know that, to win
success in life’s undertakings, vigorous health is a
prime requisite. He elected the arid plains and mountains
of our western country, as a likely locality wherein
he might build up a constitution sturdy and strong.</p>


<h3>HE DASHED INTO THE VORTEX OF THE CHASE.</h3>

<p>It was in the summer of 1883 that he entered the
then “wild and woolly” town of Little Missouri, situated
on the Northern Pacific Railroad, in the very
heart of the “bad lands” of Dakota. Little Missouri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
contained at that time some of the worst “bad men”
and outlaws to be found outside the borders of civilization.
But it was not in the town that he expected to
find the health and strength to carry him through the
strenuous life he, perhaps, had already mapped out, but
in the saddle, camp, and chase, by living close to nature
and taking “pot luck” with the rough and rugged men
who became his companions, and who understood him
and whom he understood from the outset. During
that summer, with one man and a pack-outfit, he hunted
over the country, from Yellowstone Park to the Black
Hills, from the Black Hills to the Big Horn Mountains,
through the Big Horn Basin to Jackson Hole and
in the majestic Rocky Mountains, back to Yellowstone
Park, down Clark’s Fork to the Yellowstone, the Big
and Little Horn Rivers, through the Crow Indian
Reservation where General George A. Custer, the gallant
and lamented soldier, went to a heroic death.
Back again to the “bad lands” of the Little Missouri,
went Theodore Roosevelt, having hunted buffaloes,
elk, deer, antelope, mountain sheep, bear, lion and
the smaller game of that country. He fished in the
numerous mountain streams, and lived the rough,
hardy life of a frontiersman. For five months, the
heavens were his only canopy. He caught and killed
game for his own use, saddled his mounts, did his own
cooking, was his own scout, and performed his half of
the night-work. The capacity to do for himself and
meet men upon an equal basis—self-reliance and personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
courage,—came to him as the fruition of this
and similar experiences in the Far West. I know that
this democracy still influences him.</p>


<h3>HE SHOWED PIONEERS HOW TO WINTER CATTLE.</h3>

<p>Having studied the conditions of the wild animal
life of mountain and plain, he found that the fattest
and best wild game inhabited the “bad lands” of Little
Missouri. Although without food or shelter, save
what they could gather from the grasses that grew
there, the wild game was in splendid condition. As a
result of these conditions, the young hunter made up
his mind to engage in the business of raising cattle.
Old frontiersmen told him that cattle could not be
wintered in the “bad lands.” This he disputed, and he
argued, as proof of his contention, the fact that the
finest wild game was to be found there, and he could
not understand why cattle would not thrive under the
same conditions. The following spring, Theodore
Roosevelt shipped to Little Missouri, by the Northern
Pacific Railroad, several hundred head of cattle, hired
<i>vaqueros</i>, purchased mess-wagons and provisions, and
drove the cattle from the cars to his range in the very
heart of the “bad lands.” There he took up the life of
a western ranchman, and asked of his men nothing
that he would not undertake himself. He faced the
most violent blizzards while rounding up the cattle for
safety. I remember this intrepid son of fortune, participating
in the stampedes, doing his share of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
night-herding, breaking his own horses, sleeping at
night with his saddle for a pillow, and, perhaps, the
snow for a blanket, eating the same rough, substantial
fare as his employees, and evidencing the indomitable
will, courage and endurance which brought to him the
affection and respect of his men.</p>


<h3>HE CIVILIZED MANY “BAD MEN” BY HIS INFLUENCE.</h3>

<p>The country at that time was the habitat of horse
thieves, stage robbers, desperadoes, and criminals in
general. Surely this “tenderfoot” from the east would
prove an excellent subject for imposition! Other men
had been made to feel that lawlessness and depredation
were united as a common lot visited upon each newcomer,
the only apparent, quick redress being in the
power and ability of the offended party to protect himself
and chastise the marauders. Mr. Roosevelt’s
salutatry to such persons came early, and was effective.
His influence and example did much toward civilizing
the “bad men” in his locality, who found him to
be an absolutely just man, possessing nerve, and handy
with gun and fists. No person ever stole a hoof of his
cattle or horses but was captured and punished according
to the laws then existing in that country.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt early acquired the reputation of
being abundantly able to protect himself and his interests,
his aptitude along such lines being brought out in
bold relief by what is remembered in the west as the
Marquis De Mores incident. Marquis De Mores was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a Frenchman by birth and a western ranchman
through preference. He went west heralded as a duelist
of great reputation, and located upon a ranch some
miles distant from that of the subject of this article.
Although thoroughly an honorable man, he believed in
governing the country by force, and it was the popular
impression that the cowboys in his employ were “killers”
and ready to fight at the drop of the hat. Soon
after De Mores had established his headquarters in a
town called Medora, Roosevelt’s cowboys and those in
De Mores’ employ became involved in a dispute over
some cattle, which resulted in a pitched battle between
the disputants. Victory, and a decisive one, perched
upon the Roosevelt standard. De Mores’ anger and
chagrin were boundless when he learned of the outcome
of the affair, and he informed his men that, if
they could not whip Roosevelt’s cowboys, he, personally,
could whip their boss, and that some day he
would go to Roosevelt’s ranch and accomplish such a
task. Roosevelt heard of this threat and sent immediate
word to De Mores that he need not trouble to
undertake the journey to his (Roosevelt’s) ranch, but
that he would meet him half way, at any designated
point, when any differences could be speedily, if not
peacefully, adjusted. Marquis De Mores did not
choose to seriously consider our friend’s message, and
the impression became prevalent and widespread in
that section of the country that the Frenchman’s hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
had been “called” and that he had been found bluffing.</p>


<h3>“GAMENESS” WAS NEEDED; ROOSEVELT HAD PLENTY.</h3>

<p>In those days, if there was one attribute of character
and make-up more thoroughly acceptable than another,
to the average westerner, it was the “gameness” a man
possessed and displayed at an opportune time, such
qualities always proving the open sesame to the regard
and affections of the men of the camp. The De Mores
episode gained for Roosevelt no little distinction. Contrary
to predictions, his cattle industry proved to be a
financial success. The cattle wintered well in the “bad
lands,” and, from there, he shipped some of the finest
beeves ever placed in the Chicago market. He remained
in the business for about three years, when he
found himself the owner of several thousand head of
cattle, splendid ranch houses, and corrals, and no
doubt he could have remained in the business and become
one of the cattle kings of the west. But by that
time he had obtained what he went west for,—vigorous
health and an iron constitution, the result of his
labor and life on the plains, had come to him and he
was ready for greater things. He gave to the people
of the west an example of splendid integrity and forceful
character, early winning their esteem and loyalty,
the possession of which he has never forfeited but
rather increased by the continued exercise of the sturdy
independence which found such early expression
among a people whose pluck and perseverance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
upbuilding of a great and new country has been immortalized
in song and legend.</p>


<h3>HIS FRONTIER LIFE WAS AMPLY WORTH THE WHILE.</h3>

<p>As a legislator, police commissioner, governor and
soldier, he has proved his capacity and worth, performing
his work well and conscientiously. His fellow
citizens, regardless of geographical distribution, believe
that he will not be found wanting in the discharge
of the exacting duties of his present exalted station,
and his career may well be an inspiration to American
youths. To all who have ever lived the untrammeled
life of plain and mountain, the sweet memory of it
abideth forever. To our president the freedom of it
still strongly appeals, and we find him making occasional
excursions into a country where the pleasures
of the camp and the chase are still to be found, and
where democracy prevails. To live as he did, and accomplish
what he has, meeting the conditions of a new
country, gaining health, strength, and a knowledge of
men, was indeed worth while.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Brave Volunteer Fights His Way
to the Head of the American
Army.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>GENERAL MILES has had a remarkable military
career.</p>

<p>He was not quite twenty-two when Fort
Sumter was fired upon, and was, at the time,
employed in a store near Boston. He spent his money
in organizing a company, of which he was elected captain,
but was commissioned only as a lieutenant, on account
of his age. But he rapidly rose to be captain,
colonel, brigadier-general and major-general. General
Hancock quickly discovered his abilities. He was in
charge of that commander’s line at Chancellorsville,
and held his own successfully against every attack by
Lee’s veterans. The second day, he was seriously
wounded, and General Hancock, in a letter to Washington
urging his promotion, said: “If Colonel Miles
lives, he will be one of the most distinguished of our
officers.”</p>

<p>In February, 1865, this young man of twenty-six
commanded the Second Army Corps. Never before
had an American officer, at that age, had charge of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
large a body of soldiers. When Lee surrendered at
Appomattox, he had command of the First Division of
the Second Army Corps.</p>


<h3>SIX YEARS OF INDIAN FIGHTING.</h3>

<p>General Miles is best known as an Indian fighter.
His six years of work among the Indians covered a belt
of country from the Rio Grande to Canada, and four
hundred miles wide. In 1874, powerful Indian tribes
roamed over this land. But Miles and his companions-in-arms,
officers and soldiers, guarded the newly constructed
railroads, and the towns which arose on the
plains, until civilization prevailed. In 1876, he fought
at Staked Plains, defeating the Cheyennes, Kiowas and
Comanches. He subjugated the Sioux, and drove Sitting
Bull, Crazy Horse and other braves across the
Canada line. In September, he conquered the Nez
Percés, with Chief Joseph; in 1878, the Bannocks. For
five years,—(1880-1885),—he commanded the Columbia
Department; in 1885, he was transferred to the
Arizona Department, and subdued the Apaches under
Geronimo and Natchez. He was made a major-general,
United States Army, April 5, 1890; in 1891, he
closed the war with the Sioux.</p>

<p>General Miles carries the honorable scars of four
serious bullet-wounds. His wife was a Sherman,
daughter of Judge Sherman, and niece of ex-Secretary
Sherman and of General William Tecumseh Sherman.
She is a “comrade” as well as a home-companion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
went with him to inspect fortifications and visit our
southern camps during the late war.</p>


<h3>HIS RECORD IN THE CIVIL WAR.</h3>

<p>In the Civil War he was noted for his audacity and
dash. He was a fighting commander. He never hesitated
to obey an order to advance, and he never wanted
to retreat. His courage was an inspiration to his
troops, and undoubtedly prevented disaster on more
than one occasion. Hancock had the utmost confidence
in Miles, and put him to the front to bear the brunt of
the enemy: the latter never failed his chief. When the
break took place at Reams’ Station,—that unfortunate
battle, the name of which is said to have been printed
on the heart of Hancock like Calais in the heart of
Queen Mary,—Miles and his staff pushed to the very
front to stay the backward rush of the troops, and the
gallant defense which he offered to the victorious
enemy saved the day from becoming one of the great
catastrophes of the war.</p>

<p>While Miles is famous for his gallantry as a commander,
he is equally noted for his coolness and good
judgment. He always insisted upon the proper treatment
of his men by the commissary department, and
his division, the Second Corps, never had any reason to
complain of want of attention on the part of their general
to their comforts. “Good treatment and good
fighting” was his rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<h3>A LOYAL, DAUNTLESS LEADER.</h3>

<p>As commander of the army, General Miles is not
different from the Miles of thirty years ago. Those
who knew him then say that he has changed very little
in appearance, and not at all in his devotion to duty
and to the army. He was always above petty jealousy,
and never withheld from a subordinate the credit
due to him,—and this is a prominent trait in Miles to-day.
The public wondered that Miles showed no impatience
when he was not sent in command of the
troops to Cuba, but those who knew the General felt
that he was too firm a believer in discipline to object to
any lawful act of his commander-in-chief. Miles is
known to have been anxious to lead the fighting in the
only war likely to offer him an opportunity to prove his
ability as a general in command, but he obeyed without
a murmur the orders which placed in other hands the
leadership of the troops in the field. He maintained a
vigilant supervision of all that was going on, and was
especially watchful of the supplies which had been
intended for the support of the army at the front. His
criticism of those supplies has caused a widespread
sensation and there were earnest demands that all the
facts should be known, and the responsibility fixed.</p>


<h3>A YOUNG MAN’S CHANCES IN THE ARMY.</h3>

<p>General Miles is not willing to see callers when he is
busy with his official duties. At other times, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
readily approached. He said to me that he did not
care to talk about matters pending in connection with
the army. I assured him at once that I had no intention
of questioning him in regard to the matters to
which he alluded, but would be glad to have his opinion
about the chances of a young man in the army, and
the proper qualifications for one seeking to enter the
service.</p>

<div class="caption">YOUTH</div>
</div>

<p>General Miles replied that he would not object to
answering questions on that point.</p>

<p>I asked the general if he thought an education necessary
for a good soldier.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the reply; “education is a good
thing for a soldier, and he ought to be educated in more
than reading, writing and arithmetic. He ought to
have character, stability, energy and a willingness to
obey. These qualities are largely brought out by the
right kind of education. It can be set down as a rule,
that a worthless civilian would be a worthless soldier.
There are exceptions to the rule, of course, but the
man who has the right kind of training to make him a
good citizen is the best man for the army.”</p>


<h3>CHARACTER THE FOUNDATION OF TRUE COURAGE.</h3>

<p>“And such a man will get along best in the army?”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“Most assuredly,” answered General Miles. “You
can see that by looking over the list of heroes in the
past. They have always been men of character. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
officer should be a man of character, in order to command
the respect of his men. Without their respect
and esteem, he cannot succeed. With them, he can accomplish
great things, if the opportunity offers. Look
at the regard which the English soldiers had for the
Duke of Wellington. It was chiefly based on his character,
for he was not what might be called a lovable
man. His men were ready to go anywhere that he
sent them, for they knew their commander, and had
confidence in him. Character is as important in a
great general as in a great statesman or a great merchant.
Character is just as necessary, also, in the private
as in the officer. It will command recognition in
time.”</p>

<p>“Would you say, General, that the army really holds
out very great chances for advancement?”</p>

<p>“I think it holds out as many chances as any profession
or business does; for in the army, as in business,
merit wins every time, and if a soldier has real
merit, it is bound to be recognized, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“There is a chance, then, for every man who goes
into the army as a private to become a general?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I would make the statement as
strong as that, but I believe that every soldier who deserves
it will be promoted.”</p>

<p>“Would you advise young men to select the army in
preference to other professions?”</p>

<p>“That depends,” the general replied, “on the young
man. If he is fairly educated and properly trained, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
his tastes are military, and he understands the importance
and duty of discipline, if he is willing to learn
and to obey, he will make no mistake in entering the
army. There are, of course, other circumstances, such
as family claims and associations which must have
their bearing upon the choice of a career, but, speaking
from the standpoint of the army, I would say that
it is a good place for any young American with the
right qualifications.”</p>


<h3>COURAGE NATURAL TO AMERICANS.</h3>

<p>When asked about the conduct of our troops in the
late war, General Miles answered: “Our soldiers
fought bravely, but nothing else could be expected
from American soldiers. They have no superiors in
the field, and American history has shown that they
can cope successfully with any foe. Courage is a natural
virtue with all Americans, and the late war has
shown that it has not been weakened any by years of
peace. There is no better material in the world for an
army than the young men who grow up in the cities
and towns and on the farms of the United States. I
have already said that a young man who enters the
army should have education, and the intelligence of the
average American soldier is one of his most valuable
traits. He is not merely a machine; he is an intelligent
machine. He is conscious of his duty and his
responsibilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you think of the future of the army, General?”</p>

<p>General Miles replied deliberately: “The American
people will never have any occasion to be otherwise
than proud of their army. It will be found equal to
every call that can possibly be made upon it, and prepared
to face any danger in defense of the nation.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Making the Most of His Opportunities
Wins a Coveted Embassy.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>“YOU may say what you will,” said a young
lawyer in a conversation wherein Joseph
H. Choate and his ability were the topics
of conversation; “a man cannot hope to
distinguish himself without special opportunities.”</p>

<p>“Not even in law?” questioned one.</p>

<p>“There least of all,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Well,” said another, “the period in which Mr.
Choate began his career in New York is commonly referred
to as the golden age of the metropolitan bar.
James T. Brady was a conspicuous figure in the popular
eye. Charles O’Connor had already made a lasting
impression. Mr. Evarts was in the front rank in politics
as well as in law. Mr. Hoffman was equally prominent
on the Democratic side, and Mr. Stanford’s brilliancy
in cross-examination had given him an enviable
reputation. The legal heavens were studded with stars
of such lustre as to make any newcomer feel doubtful
about his ability to compete. But Choate displayed no
anxiety. He hung out his shingle and began to look
for clients, and they came.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<h3>A YOUNG LAWYER’S CHANCES THEN AND NOW.</h3>

<p>“That was before the war,” resumed the original
speaker. “Do you imagine he could have attained his
position as the foremost American lawyer under conditions
as they exist to-day without special advantages?”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” I said, and added that it was probable
that Mr. Choate, if approached, would kindly throw
light on the subject.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this idea, I called one evening at the
residence of Mr. Choate. Previous inquiry at the law
office of Evarts, Choate and Beaman, on Wall Street,
elicited the information that Mr. Choate’s days were
filled to overflowing with legal affairs of great importance.
Consequently it was surprising to find him
so ready to see a stranger at his home.</p>

<p>It was into a long room on the ground floor that I
was introduced, three of its walls lined with tall, dark
walnut book-laden cases, lighted by a bright grate fire
and by a student’s lamp on the table by night, and by
two heavily-shaded windows by day. As I entered, the
great lawyer was busy prodding the fire, and voiced
a resonant “good-evening” without turning. In a
moment or two he had evoked a blaze, and assumed a
standing attitude before the fire, his hands behind
him.</p>


<h3>ARE SPECIAL ADVANTAGES NECESSARY?</h3>

<p>“Well, sir,” he began, “what do you wish?”</p>

<p>“A few minutes of your time,” I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?” he questioned succinctly.</p>

<p>“I wish to discover whether you believe special
advantages at the beginning of a youth’s career are
necessary to success?”</p>

<p>“Why my opinion?”</p>

<p>I was rather floored for an instant, but endeavored
to make plain the natural interest of the public in the
subject and his opinion, but he interrupted me with the
query:—</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask a man who never had any advantages,”
at the same time fixing upon me one of his
famous “what’s in thy heart?” glances.</p>

<p>“Then you have had them?” I said, grasping wildly
at the straw that might keep the interviewer afloat.</p>

<p>“A few, not many,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Are advantages necessary to success to-day?”</p>

<p>“Define advantages and success,” he said abruptly,
evidently questioning whether it was worth while to
talk. A distinguished looking figure he made, looking
on, as I collected my defining ability. The room
seemed full of his atmosphere. He is a tall man, oaken
in strength, with broad, intelligent face, high forehead,
alert, wide-set eyes, and firm, even lips expressive of
great self-control. His fluency, his wit and humor, his
sound knowledge, his strength and perfect self-possession,
were all suggested by his face and expression,
and by the firmness of his squarely set head and massive
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Let us,” I said, “say money, opportunity, friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
good advice, and personal popularity for early advantages.”</p>

<p>“The first isn’t necessary,” said the jurist, leisurely
adjusting his hands in his pockets. “Opportunity
comes to everyone, but all have not a mind to see;
friends you can do without for a time; good advice
we take too late, and popularity usually comes too early
or too tardy to be appreciated. Define success.”</p>


<h3>WHAT SUCCESS MEANS.</h3>

<p>“I might mention fame, position, income, as examples
of what the world deems success.”</p>

<p>“Foolish world!” said Mr. Choate. “The most successful
men sometimes have not one of all these. All
I can say is that early advantages won’t bring a man a
knowledge of the law, nor enable him to convince a
jury. What he needs is years of close application, the
ability to stick until he has mastered the necessary
knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Where did you obtain your wide knowledge of the
law?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Reading at home and fighting in the courts,—principally
fighting in the courts.”</p>

<p>“And was there any good luck about obtaining your
first case? Was it secured by special effort?”</p>


<h3>THE GOOD LUCK OF BEING PREPARED.</h3>

<p>“None, unless it was the good luck of having a sign
out, large enough for people to see. The rest of it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
hard work, getting the evidence and the law fixed in
my mind.</p>

<p>“You believe, of course,” I ventured, “that advantageous
opportunities do come to all?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, drawing up a chair and resignedly
seating himself. “I believe that opportunities come to
all,—not the same opportunities, nor the same kind of
opportunities, nor opportunities half so valuable in
some cases as in others, but they do come, and if seen
and grasped will work a vast improvement in the life
and character of an individual. Every boy cannot be
president, but my word for it, if he is industrious, he
can improve his position in the world.”</p>


<h3>TURNING OBSTACLES INTO AIDS.</h3>

<p>“It has been said, Mr. Choate,” I went on, “that you
often ascribe both your success in particular cases, and
your general success at the bar, to good luck and
happy accidents.”</p>

<p>“Just so, just so,” he answered, smiling in a manner
that is at once a question and a mark of approbation.
“I hope I have always made the most of good luck
and happy accidents. We all should. My friend, John
E. Parsons, once denounced a defendant insurance
company as a ‘vampire,—one of those bloodless creatures
that feed on the blood of the people.’ It was a
savage address of the old-fashioned style, and convincing,
until I asked the judge and jury if they knew what
a vampire really is. ‘Look at the Quaker gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
who is president of this company,’ I said, pointing him
out. ‘Also look at that innocent young man, his attorney,
who sits next to him with a smile on his face. You
thought vampires were something out of the way when
Brother Parsons described them, but these are regular,
genuine vampires.’ That brought a laugh and good
feeling, and I suppose you might call the whole thing
an opportunity to turn a bad assault into a helpful
incident.”</p>

<p>The great lawyer was a study as he spoke, his easy,
unaffected attitude and bearing itself carrying weight.
His manner of accepting the intrusion with mild acquiescence
and attention, but with no intention of allowing
himself to be bored, was interesting. It has
become customary to say that he is a poor politician,
and as the term is ordinarily employed and understood,
he is, because he is ever ready to say what he really
thinks. It is precisely this quality, this freedom from
cowardice, this detestation of truckling to ignorance
and brutality, this independence, that cause him to
stand out so boldly in the legal profession.</p>


<h3>DOES LACK OF OPPORTUNITY JUSTIFY.</h3>

<p>“If equally valuable opportunities do not come to
all,” I went on, “hasn’t an individual a right to complain
and justify his failure?”</p>

<p>“We have passed the period when we believe that all
men are equal,” said Mr. Choate. “We know they’re
free, but some men are born less powerful than others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
But if an individual does not admit to himself that he
is deficient in strength or reasoning powers, if he
claims all the rights and privileges given others because
he is ‘as good as they’ then his success or failure
is upon his own head. He should prove that he is
what he thinks he is, and be what he aspires to be.”</p>

<p>“You believe, of course, that an individual may overestimate
his abilities.”</p>

<p>“Believe it,” he answered, with a deprecatory wave
of the hand, “trust the law to teach that. But if a
man does overestimate himself he still owes it to himself
to endeavor to prove that his estimate of himself
is correct. We all need to. If he fails, he will be learning
his limitations, which is better than never finding
them out. No man can justify inaction.”</p>

<p>“What do you consider to be the genuine battle of a
youth to-day?—the struggle to bear poverty while
working to conquer?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” came the quick answer. “Poor clothes
and poor food and a poor place to dwell in are disagreeable
things and must be made to give place to
better, of course, but one can be partially indifferent
to them. The real struggle is to hang on to every advantage,
and strengthen the mind at every step. There
are persons who have learned to endure poverty so well
that they don’t mind it any longer. The struggle comes
in maintaining a purpose through poverty to the end.
It is just as difficult to maintain a purpose through
riches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Money is not an end, then, in your estimation.”</p>

<p>“Never, and need is only an incentive. Erskine made
his greatest speech with his hungry children tugging
at his coat-tail. That intense feeling that something
has got to be done is the thing that works the doing.
I never met a great man who was born rich.”</p>


<h3>MR. CHOATE’S ANTECEDENTS.</h3>

<p>This remark seemed rather striking in a way, because
of the fact that Mr. Choate’s parents were not
poor in the accepted sense. The family is rather distinguished
in New England annals. His father was a
cousin of the famous Rufus Choate, and the latter, at
the date of Joseph’s birth, January 24, 1832, was just
entering his second term in congress to distinguish
himself by a great speech on the tariff. Mr. Choate
was the youngest of four brothers, and, after receiving
a fair school education in Salem, was sent to Harvard,
where he was graduated in 1852, and later from its law
school in 1854. Influence procured him a position in
a Boston law office. After a year of practical study,
he was admitted to the bar of Massachusetts. In October
of that year he made a tour of observation in the
western states, in company with his brother William,
and on his return determined to settle in New York.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it possible, Mr. Choate,” I ventured, “that
your having had little or no worry over poverty in your
youth might cause you to underestimate the effect of
it on another, and overestimate the importance of sticking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with determination to an idea through wealth or
deprivation?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, after a few moments’ delay, in
which he picked up one of the volumes near by as if
to consult it; “no, the end to be attained makes important
the need of hanging on. I am sure it is quite
often more difficult to rise with money than without.”</p>


<h3>DOES SUCCESS BRING CONTENT AND HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>“You have had long years of distinction and comfort;
do you find that success brings content and happiness?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered, contracting his brows with
legal severity, “constant labor is happiness, and success
simply means ability to do more labor,—more
deeds far-reaching in their power and effect. Such
success brings about as much happiness as the world
provides.”</p>

<p>“I mean,” I explained, “the fruits of that which is
conventionally accepted as success; few hours of toil,
a luxuriously furnished home, hosts of friends, the
applause of the people, sumptuous repasts, and content
in idleness, knowing that enough has been done.”</p>

<p>“We never know that enough has been done,” said
the lawyer. “All this sounds pleasant, but the truth
is that the men whose great efforts have made such
things possible for themselves are the very last to desire
them. You have described what appeals to the
idler, the energyless dreamer, the fashionable dawdler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and the listless voluptuary. Enjoyment of such things
would sap the strength and deaden the ambition of a
Lincoln. The man who has attained to the position
where these things are possible is the one whose life
has been a constant refutation of the need of these
things. He is the one who has abstained, who has
conserved his mental and physical strength by living
a simple and frugal life. He has not taken more than
he needed, and never, if possible, less. His enjoyment
has been in working, and I guarantee that you will find
successful men ever to be plain-mannered persons of
simple tastes, to whom sumptuous repasts are a bore,
and luxury a thing apart. They may live surrounded
by these things, but personally take little interest in
them, knowing them to be mere trappings, which
neither add to nor detract from character.”</p>


<h3>THE DELUSION OF LUXURY AND EASE.</h3>

<p>“Is there no pleasure then in luxury and ease without
toil?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“None,” said the speaker emphatically. “There is
pleasure in rest after labor. It is gratifying to relax
when you really need relaxation, to be weary and be
able to rest. But to enjoy anything you must first feel
the need of it. But no more,” he said, putting up his
hand conclusively. “Surely you have enough to make
clear what you wish to know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Choate had talked for ten minutes. His ease
of manner, quickness of reply, smoothness of expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and incisive diction, were fascinating beyond description.
As I was about to leave, I inquired if he
would object to my making our conversation the subject
of an article, to which he smiled his willingness,
waiving objection with a slight movement of the hand.</p>


<h3>MR. CHOATE’S SHARE OF NEW YORK’S LAW BUSINESS.</h3>

<p>In court circles it is common report that Mr.
Choate’s contemporaries divide half of the business
among them, and Mr. Choate has the other half to
himself.</p>

<p>This is due to his wonderful simplicity and directness,
which never falters for a moment for thought or
word. He drives straight for the heart and head of
client or officer, witness or counsel, judge or juryman.
A distinguished barrister has said of him:</p>

<p>“Where other lawyers are solemn and portentous,
or wild or unpleasant, he is humorous and human. He
assumes no superior air; often he speaks with his hands
in his pockets. He strives to stir up no dark passions.
While he is always a little bit keener, a little finer and
more witty than the man in the box or on the bench,
yet he is always a brother man to him.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Village Boy’s Gift of Oratory Earns
Him Wealth and Fame.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>OF the busy men of the world, there are none
more so than Chauncey M. Depew, until recently
president of the New York Central and
Hudson River Railroad, and now president of
the board which looks after all the Vanderbilt interests.
One must have something worthy his attention
to gain admittance to the busy man, and I need say no
more for the present interview than that the distinguished
orator and statesman saw fit to discuss the
possibilities of young men and their future, and gave
readily of his time and opinions. I stated to him the
object of my interview,—that it was intended to obtain
his views as to what qualities in young men best make
for success, and to ask him, if possible, to point out
the way, by the aid of example, to better work and
greater success for them. He smiled approvingly, and,
to my question, whether, in his opinion, the opportunities
awaiting ambitious young men are less or more
than they have been in the past, replied:—</p>

<p>“More, decidedly more. Our needs in every field
were never greater. The country is larger, and, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the population is greater, the means to supply its increased
wants require more and more talent, so that
any young man may gain a foothold who makes his
effort with industry and intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that there is an excellent position
awaiting everyone?”</p>

<p>“I mean to say that, while positions are not so
numerous that any kind of a young man will do, yet
they are so plentiful that you can scarcely find a young
man of real energy and intelligence who does not hold
a responsible position of some kind. The chief affairs
are in the hands of young men.”</p>

<p>“Was it different in your day, when you were beginning?”</p>

<p>“Energy and industry told heavily in the balance
then, as now, but the high places were not available for
young men because the positions were not in existence.
We had to make the places, in those days; and not only
that, but we were obliged to call ourselves to the tasks.
To-day, a man fits himself and is called. There are
more things to do.”</p>

<p>“How was it with boys, in your day, who wanted to
get an education?”</p>


<h3>HE HAD TO EARN HIS OWN WAY.</h3>

<p>“With most of them, it was a thing to earn. Why,
the thing that I knew more about than anything else,
as I grew from year to year, was the fact that I had
nothing to expect, and must look out for myself. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
can’t tell you how clear my parents made this point to
me. It absolutely glittered, so plain was it.”</p>

<p>“Your parents were Americans?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was born at Peekskill, in 1834.”</p>

<p>Although Mr. Depew modestly refrains from discussing
his ancestry, he comes from the best New
England stock. He descends, through remote paternal
ancestors, from French Huguenots, who were among
those who came to America in the early days of the
country, and who founded the village of New Rochelle,
in Westchester county. His mother, Martha Mitchell,
was of illustrious and patriotic New England descent,
being a member of the family to which belonged Roger
Sherman, a signer of the Declaration of Independence;
and he is a lineal descendant of the Rev. Josiah Sherman,
chaplain of the Seventh Connecticut Continental
infantry, and of Gabriel Ogden, of the New Jersey
militia, both of whom served in the American Revolution.</p>

<p>“Had you any superior advantages in the way of
money, books, or training?” I continued.</p>

<p>“If you want to call excellent training a superior
advantage I had it. Training was a great point with
us. We trained with the plow, the ax, and almost any
other implement we could lay our hands on. I might
even call the switch used at our house an early advantage,
and, I might say, superior to any other in our
vicinity. I had some books, but our family was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
rich, even for those times. We were comfortably
situated, nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Do you owe more to your general reading than you
do to your early school training?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. I attended the school in our village
regularly, until I went to college; but I was not distinguished
for scholarship, except on the ballground.”</p>

<p>“Do you attribute much of your success in life to
physical strength?”</p>

<p>“It is almost indispensable.”</p>


<h3>HE ENTERED YALE AT EIGHTEEN.</h3>

<p>“I was always strong. The conditions tended to
make strong men, in those days. I went to college in
my eighteenth year. I think I acquired a broader view
there, and sound ideals which have been great helps.
It was not a period of toil, however, as some would
have made it.”</p>

<p>His time at Yale was in no respect wasted. The
vigorous, athletic, fun-loving boy was developing into
a man with a strength and independence of character,
very imperfectly understood at first by the already long
list of men who liked him.</p>

<p>“What profession did you fix upon as the field for
your life work?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That of the law. I always looked forward to that;
and, after my graduation, in 1856, I went into a law
office (that of Hon. William Nelson,) at Peekskill, and
prepared for practice. That was a time of intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
political excitement. There were factions in the Democratic
party, and the Whig party seemed to be passing
away. The Republican party, or People’s party, as it
had first been called, was organized in 1856, and men
were changing from side to side. Naturally, I was
mixed in the argument, and joined the Republican
party.</p>

<p>“When I was graduated at Yale College, in 1856,”
he continued, “I came home to the village of Peekskill
to meet my father, my grandfather, my uncles and my
brothers, all old Hunker, state-rights, pro-slavery
Democrats. But I had been through the fiery furnace
of the Kansas-Nebraska excitement at New Haven, and
had come out of it a free-soil Republican. Two days
after my return, I stood, a trembling boy, upon a platform
to give voice in the campaign which was then in
progress, to that conversion which nearly broke my
father’s heart, and almost severed me from all family
ties. It seemed then as if the end of the world had
come for me in the necessity for this declaration of
convictions and principles, but I expressed my full belief.
In this sense, I believe a young man should be
strong, and that such difficult action is good for him.”</p>


<h3>HIS BEGINNING AS AN ORATOR.</h3>

<p>“Is that where you began your career as an orator?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“You mean as a stump-speaker? Yes. I talked for
Fremont and Dayton, our candidates, but they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
defeated. We did not really expect success, though,
and yet we carried eleven states. After that, I went
back to my law books, and was admitted to the bar in
1858. That was another campaign year, and I spoke
for the party then, as I did two years later, when I was
a candidate for the state assembly, and won.”</p>

<p>The real glory hidden by this modest statement is
that Mr. Depew’s oratory in the campaign of 1858
gained him such distinction that he was too prominent
to be passed over in 1860. During that campaign, he
stumped the entire state, winning rare oratorical triumphs,
and aiding the party almost more than anyone
else. How deep an impression the young member from
Peekskill really made in the state legislature by his
admirable mastery of the complex public business
brought before him, may be gathered from the fact
that when, two years later, he was re-elected, he was
speedily made chairman of the committee on ways
and means. He was also elected speaker, <i>pro tem.</i>, and
at the next election, when his party was practically defeated
all along the line, he was returned.</p>

<p>After briefly referring to the active part he took in
the Lincoln campaign, I asked:—</p>

<p>“When did you decide upon your career as a railroad
official?”</p>

<p>“In 1866. I was retained by Commodore Vanderbilt
as attorney for the New York and Harlem Road.”</p>

<p>“To what do you attribute your rise as an official
in that field?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hard work. That was a period of railroad growth.
There were many small roads and plenty of warring
elements. Out of these many small roads, when once
united, came the great systems which now make it
possible to reach California in a few days. Anyone
who entered upon the work at that time had to encounter
those conditions, and if he continued at it, to
change them. I was merely a counselor at first.”</p>

<p>In 1869, Mr. Depew was made attorney for the New
York Central and Hudson River Railroad, and afterward
a director. This was the period of the development
of the Vanderbilt system. Mr. Depew was a constant
adviser of the Vanderbilts, and, by his good judgment
and sagacious counsel, maintained their constant
respect and friendship. In 1875, he was made general
counsel for the entire system and a director in each one
of the roads.</p>


<h3>A SALARY OF .5,000 A YEAR.</h3>

<p>It has often been urged by the sinister-minded, that
it was something against him to have gained so much
at the hands of the Vanderbilts. The truth is that this
is his chief badge of honor. Many times he has won
influence and votes for the Vanderbilt interests, but
always by the use of wit, oratorical persuasion and legitimate,
honorable argument,—never by the methods of
the lobbyist. Commodore Vanderbilt engaged him as
counsel for the New York Central Railroad, at a
salary of $25,000 a year,—then equal to the salary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the president of the United States,—and he always
acknowledged that Mr. Depew earned the money.</p>

<p>He is now the head of the entire Vanderbilt system,
or the controlling spirit of thirty distinct railroads, besides
being a director in the Wagner Palace Car Company,
the Union Trust Company, the Western Union
Telegraph Company, the Equitable Life Insurance
Society, the Western Transit Company, the West
Shore and International Bridge Company, the Morris
Run Coal Mining Company, the Clearfield Bituminous
Coal Corporation, the Hudson River Bridge Company,
the Canada Southern Bridge Company, the Niagara
River Bridge Company, the Niagara Grand Island
Bridge Company, the Tonawanda Island Bridge Company,
the American Safe Deposit Company, the Mutual
Gas Light Company, and the Brooklyn Storage and
Warehouse Company.</p>

<p>“How much of your time each day,” I asked, “have
you given, upon an average, to your professional
duties?”</p>

<p>“Only a moderate number of hours. I do not believe
in overwork. The affairs of life are not important
enough to require it, and the body cannot endure it.
Just an ordinary day’s labor of eight or ten hours has
been my standard.”</p>

<p>“Your official duties never drew you wholly from the
political field, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Entirely, except special needs of the party, when
I have been urged to accept one task after another. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
believe that every man’s energies should be at the disposal
of his country.”</p>

<p>“On the political side, what do you think is the essential
thing for success?”</p>

<p>“The very things that are essential anywhere else—honesty,
consistency and hard work.”</p>

<p>“It requires no strain of character, no vacillation?”</p>

<p>“For twenty-five years,” answered Mr. Depew, “I
was on all occasions to the front in political battles,
and I never found that political opinions or activity
made it necessary to break friendships or make them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Depew’s political career is already so well known
that it need not be reviewed here.</p>

<p>After three years of service as vice-president of the
New York Central Railroad, he was elevated, in 1885,
to the presidency. While thus given a position of great
influence in the business world, his growing reputation
made him eligible for greater political honors than any
for which he had yet been named. In 1888 he was the
presidential candidate of the Republicans of New York
state, at the national convention of the party, and received
the solid vote of his state delegation, but withdrew
his name. President Harrison offered him the
position of secretary of state, to succeed Mr. Blaine,
but he declined.</p>


<h3>OPPORTUNITIES OF TO-DAY.</h3>

<p>“What do you think of the opportunities to-day?
Has the recent war aided us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is the best thing for the young men of to-day
that could have happened! The new possessions mean
everything to young men, who are going to be old men
by and by. We, as a nation, are going to find, by the
wise utilization of the conditions forced upon us, how
to add incalculably to American enterprise and opportunity
by becoming masters of the sea, and entering
with the surplus of our manufactures the markets of
the world. The solid merchants are to undertake the extension
of American trade, but the young men will be
called in to do the work under their guidance. The
young man who is ready is naturally the one chosen.”</p>

<p>“You think a tide of prosperity waits for every
young American?”</p>

<p>“It may not exactly wait, but he can catch it easily.”</p>

<p>“It is said,” I went on, “that any field or profession
carefully followed, will bring material success. Is that
the thing to be aimed at?”</p>

<p>“Material success does not constitute an honorable
aim. If that were true, a grasping miser would be the
most honorable creature on earth, while a man like
Gladstone, great without money, would have been an
impossibility. The truth is that material success is
usually the result of a great aim, which looks to some
great public improvement. Some man plans to be an
intelligent servant of some great public need, and the
result of great energy in serving the public intelligently
is wealth. It never has been possible to become notable
in this respect in any other way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is often said that the excellent opportunities for
young men are gone.”</p>

<p>“If you listen to ordinary comment,” said Mr. Depew,
“you can come to believe that almost anything is
dead—patriotism, honor, possibilities, trade—in fact,
anything, and it’s all according with whom you talk.
There was a belief, not long ago, that the great orators
were dead, and had left no successors. Papers and
magazines were said to supply this excellent tonic.
Yet orators have appeared, great ones, and in the face
of the beauty and grace and fire which animates some
of them, you read the speeches of the older celebrities,
and wonder what was in them that stirred men.”</p>

<p>“And this field is also open to young men?”</p>

<p>“Not as a profession, of course, but as a means to real
distinction, certainly. The field was never before so
open. I have listened to Stephen A. Douglas, with his
vigorous argument, slow enunciation, and lack of magnetism;
to Abraham Lincoln, with his resistless logic
and quaint humor; to Tom Corwin, Salmon P. Chase,
William H. Seward, Charles Sumner, and Wendell
Phillips; and, as I look back and recall what they said,
and the effect which they produced, and then estimate
what they might do with the highly cultivated and critical
audiences of to-day, I see the opportunity that
awaits the young man here. Only Wendell Phillips
strikes me as having possessed qualities which are not
yet duplicated or surpassed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>


<h3>THERE IS MORE THAN ONE KIND OF SUCCESS.</h3>

<p>“You recognize more than one kind of success in
this world, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we can’t all be presidents of the United States.
Any man is successful who does well what comes to his
hand, and who works to improve himself so that he
may do better. The man with the ideal, struggling to
carry it out, is the successful man. Of course, there
are all grades of ideals, and the man with the highest,
given the proportionate energy, is the most successful.
The world makes way for that kind of young man.”</p>

<p>“Do you consider that happiness in the successful
man consists in reflecting over what he has done or
what he may do?”</p>

<p>“I should say that it consists in both. No man who
has accomplished a great deal could sit down and fold
his hands. The enjoyment of life would be instantly
gone if you removed the possibility of doing something.
When through with his individual affairs, a man wants
a wider field, and of course that can only be in public
affairs. Whether the beginner believes it or not, he
will find that he cannot drop interest in life at the end,
whatever he may think about it in the beginning.”</p>

<p>“The aim of the young man of to-day should be,
then—?”</p>

<p>“To do something worth doing, honestly. Get
wealth, if it is gotten in the course of an honorable
public service. I think, however, the best thing to get
is the means of doing good, and then doing it.”</p>

<h2 class="num">XIX<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Chance-Found Book the Turning
Point in a United States
Senator’s Career.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>HE wasn’t much of a boy to look at, this Dolliver
boy of ten, trudging off to school every morning
in the West Virginia hamlet of Kingwood,
where the mountains are so brown in winter
and so green in summer. To the master of the little
subscription school he was Jonathan Prentiss Dolliver;
to the comrades of sport and study he was just plain
“Prent,” a sturdy little chap, whose hair refused to stay
combed, whose clothes showed the rough-and-tumble
of play, whose love for the mountains far exceeded his
love of arithmetic.</p>

<p>Somebody lost a copy of the “Congressional
Record” about that time,—a bound volume, containing
many speeches of senators and representatives.
“Prent” found it. His boyish imagination was fired.
Hour after hour he pored over its pages, committing
to memory several of the passages in the speeches.</p>

<p>One day the school committee called,—an auspicious
event in the little schoolhouse. Young Dolliver
was asked to give a declamation. To the astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of all, the boy performed his task with force, vigor,
clearness and almost eloquence. Where did he get it?</p>

<p>“O, I can talk,” he declared; “dad’s a preacher, you
know.”</p>

<p>Thus climbed into his first forum the witty, eloquent,
magnetic Dolliver, a United States senator from the
state of Iowa at forty years of age.</p>

<p>The match of ambition having been thus applied, the
young lad studied to greater advantage. A superb
mother made sacrifices to aid him. How these American
mothers have ever helped! He took a course at
the State University at Morgantown, West Virginia.
This was in 1875, and Prentiss was only seventeen
when he stepped forth with his diploma in his hand.</p>


<h3>A SCHOOL TEACHER AT EIGHTEEN.</h3>

<p>At eighteen, he was a country school teacher himself.
The scene is laid in Victor Center, Illinois, in a yellow
schoolhouse; and, while it is only a stepping-stone in a
career full of more exciting episodes, it is worth while
to note that the youth of eighteen was able to do what
his predecessors had failed to accomplish,—make an
orderly, successful school out of a very turbulent lot of
youngsters. On one occasion he quelled a fight by simply
looking at the combatants.</p>

<p>The law, and the wide, free west captured the young
man a few years later, the former for a profession, the
latter for a home. Fort Dodge, Iowa, welcomed the
little family in 1880, and there the future senator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
wrestled with life’s serious problems in earnest. Inevitably
he was drawn into politics, that field which
always has use for men of active brain and silvery
tongue. Dolliver had both. James G. Blaine, for
whom he delivered scores of speeches, predicted, in
1884, that this dark-haired young orator of the west
would enjoy a conspicuous future. The prophecy was
not long in reaching fulfilment. From 1890, when he
was first elected to congress, until 1900, when he took
his seat in the senate, he rose steadily in importance
as a great leader and debater, until he had no superior
in the great forum of the nation.</p>

<p>His wit is one of the most attractive of his gifts. He
can tell a story with wonderful effect. His keen sense
of humor would have made him a comedian, if nature
had not cast his other faculties in a more serious mould.
Therefore, his fun only crops out at times.</p>

<p>When I asked him when and where he first began
to consider himself famous, he said:—</p>

<p>“My first term in congress gave me my first sense
of exaltation. The people up in the Iowa hills had a
little lake, and they named it after me. Then a new
postoffice was named in my honor, and a colored woman
named her baby after me. I began to think of engaging
a niche in some temple of fame.</p>

<p>“But, in my second term, I was disillusioned. A climatic
disturbance dried up the lake, free delivery wiped
out the postoffice, and the child died,—and I found
myself back at the very place whence I had started!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE STRANGE RESULT OF A LECTURE.</h3>

<p>A few years ago Mr. Dolliver was invited to deliver
a lecture in St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, before
the Young Men’s Christian Association Lyceum.
In each city, the hall was crowded wherein he spoke,
some fifteen hundred young men attending. His topic
was, “Chances for Young Men.”</p>

<p>“That,” said he to me, “was a favorite topic with
me. I believed in young men, and liked to talk with
them, knowing full well that if one can stir them up to
energy and ambition, he is doing a grand work in the
world.</p>

<p>“Well, I have not changed my opinion since the delivery
of that lecture; but, when I got back to Washington
to resume my congressional duties, a week later,
I began to hear from those particular young men. Letters
began to pour in on me. They came in bunches of
twos and threes; then in dozens, and finally in basketfuls.
Every St. Paul and Minneapolis young man who
had heard me declare that this is the young men’s age,
wrote that he fully agreed with me,—and asked me to
get him a government job!”</p>

<p>Mr. Dolliver’s services to his party were particularly
great in the controversy over the Porto Rican change
of front by the administration. The president had, in
his message to congress, in December 1899, favored
the extending of unrestricted trade opportunities to the
Porto Ricans; but, later, seeing that such a course was
opposed by many influential persons, and by several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
strong arguments, he advised the imposition of light
duties and the application of the proceeds to the island’s
own use. In the conflict which at once arose in congress,
Dolliver’s strong and eloquent plea alone saved
the measure from defeat.</p>


<h3>HIS IDEA OF GENUINE SUCCESS.</h3>

<p>When I asked him what the true idea of success is,
he replied, without a moment’s hesitation:</p>

<p>“Money-making is the cheapest kind of success. It
doesn’t indicate the highest development, by any means.
I will give you a simple illustration, embodied in an
incident which occurred this very day. A friend of
mine, a professional gentleman of high mental attainments,
had been offered a salary of ten thousand dollars
a year by a corporation engaged in transportation. He
was strongly tempted to take it, for he is working for
the government at a salary of only five thousand dollars.
He admitted to me, however, that he is capable
of far greater usefulness, in his present work, than he
would be in the employment of the railroad. Thereupon
I strongly advised him to reject the larger offer,
and he has done so. My reason was simply that money
does not measure one’s place in the world, one’s mental
triumphs, or one’s usefulness to humanity.”</p>

<p>“But money is a helpful factor in life,” I urged, “and
is considered indispensable, nowadays, in climbing up
the ladder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “if I had a son and a hundred
thousand dollars, I would keep them apart.”</p>

<p>In the senate a new member is not supposed to take
part in debates, or even discussions. The atmosphere
is not only dignified, but frozen. I strongly anticipate,
however, that there will be a thawing out before long.
The presence of Mr. Dolliver ought to act like an old-fashioned
depot stove in a cold-storage room.</p>

<h2 class="num">XX<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>Varied Business Training the
Foundation of a Long Political
Career.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>THOMAS COLLIER PLATT has succeeded
in business and in politics in a phenomenal
manner. The reason is, he has had the native
sagacity, energy and working ability of two
ordinary men, and has fairly earned his place as a
senator of the United States, as one of the political
leaders of the nation, and as president of the United
States Express Company.</p>

<p>Last summer, as I sat on the porch of the Oriental
Hotel at Manhattan Beach, for Mr. Platt’s return from
his office, he came up the steps two at a time, with the
elasticity of a man of forty. As I waited for him in
the Fifth Avenue Hotel the other day, he came into the
lobby looking very much jaded. He said: “I am very
tired, after a week’s session of the senate at Washington.
I have had a very busy day in New York. Come
up to my room.”</p>

<p>Members of the legislature, local politicians, statesmen
of national renown, sent their cards to the senator’s
room before we were fairly seated. Wearied amid this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
great press, Mr. Platt took time to say some things
about himself, and to indicate some of the elements of
his success as an encouragement and inspiration to
young men in the struggle of life.</p>

<p>“Where were you born?”</p>

<p>“In Owego, Tioga County, New York.</p>

<p>“My ancestors were Americans. They were Yankees
that came from Connecticut and Massachusetts to New
York state.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in hereditary tendencies?”</p>

<p>“I do, most certainly. Blood tells. There is nothing
so absolutely true as that blood tells in cattle, horses
and men. My father was a devoted, consistent Presbyterian.
The preachers almost counted my father’s
house a home when I was a boy. My father was my
ideal of a man every way. He was one of the few men
I ever saw whose everyday life completely harmonized
with the Christian profession.”</p>

<p>“In your Puritan home, you had to toe the mark, did
you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my parents were strict; but very tender. They
never used the rod, because we were such exceptionally
good children. We did not need it. I never saw father
or mother raise their hand against a child. My father
was a lawyer. He afterward became interested in real
estate, taking charge of extensive timber and farm
lands in the northwest, owned by a gentleman in Philadelphia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>


<h3>HIS START AS A BOY.</h3>

<p>“To what do you attribute the start you got as a boy
on the road to success?”</p>

<p>“To the principles of truth, honor, love, and labor,
which were instilled into my mind in our quiet village
home.”</p>

<p>“Where were you educated?”</p>

<p>“I attended the Owego Academy. There was nothing
out of the ordinary line in teacher or scholar. In
the academy I prepared for Yale College, which I
entered in 1849. Ill health compelled me to give up
my college course at the close of my sophomore year.
Our class contained some of the most distinguished
men ever graduated from the college. Wayne McVeigh,
Edmund Clarence Steadman, Isaac Brumley,
Judge Shiras, of the Supreme Court of the United
States; Andrew D. White, ambassador to the court of
Berlin, were among the number. Yale has grown
marvelously since my day, and the student now has
increased opportunity for knowledge, but I do not
think that the grade of talent to-day is any better than
in our time. In 1876, Yale conferred on me the degree
of master of arts.”</p>

<p>“Would you advise a young man, having a business
life in view, to attend college?”</p>

<p>“I would! The intellectual discipline, the social advantages,
the mental stimulus will be of profit to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
young man entering business in times of great enterprises
and heated competitions.”</p>


<h3>ALWAYS FOND OF READING.</h3>

<p>“Were you a reader of books?”</p>

<p>“I have always been fond of reading, and have read
books to advantage, but for forty years I have been so
engaged with business and politics that I have not had
the time to gratify my taste for literature, which is
strong. Reading is of great advantage to a young
man,—that is, the reading of good books.</p>

<p>“I was fortunate in my early friendships. A man’s
character and success are greatly effected by his
friends. A man is known by the company he keeps.
It used to be that a man was known by the newspaper
he read. That is not so now.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there are so many and so cheap that a
man can and does take and read more than one. I
read them all,—those which agree and those which
disagree with me politically.”</p>

<p>“You are reputed to have been a fine singer when a
young man.”</p>

<p>“I had a voice which gave me much delight and
seemed to please others. I was for many years the
leader of the Owego Glee Club, which was very popular.
We used to be called for as far as Elmira, Ithaca,
Auburn, and Binghamton. With Washington Gladden
to write the verses, our glee club to sing them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and Benjamin Tracy, a young lawyer of the town, to
make the speeches, we gave considerable inspiration
to the social and political gatherings of our community.”</p>


<h3>A TASTE OF MINING LIFE</h3>

<p>“What was your first venture in business?”</p>

<p>“On my return from Yale, I started a retail drug
store in my native town, and continued it for fifteen
years. I then branched out in the lumber business in
Michigan. I became connected with several local enterprises,
among them the bank, and a wagon factory.”</p>

<p>“You invested in a western mine, did you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes! I owned a third interest in a mine at Deadwood,
and in the winter of 1877 I decided to go out
and see it. It was my first trip west, and I was not
prepared for the hardships. I had to ride sixty hours
from the end of the railroad to the camp. The Indians
were on the war path and had killed a passenger on the
stage that preceded ours. As I started to enter the
coach, the driver said: ‘Are you armed?’ ‘No,’ said I.
Taking a gun from the top of the stage, he gave it to
me, and said, ‘You will need it.’ I told him I was a
tenderfoot and did not know how to shoot. He showed
me, and I took the gun with me. Luckily I did not
need it. About the first thing I saw when I reached
the camp was an example of frontier justice. Men,
with a rope, were hunting for those who had been guilty
of holding up the stage. I found the claim in which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
was interested to be one of the richest in the vicinity,
according to indications. We spent $60,000 in working
the claim. I was offered half a million dollars for
my interest in the property, which I declined. Just as
we got to paying expenses, the mine played out.”</p>

<p>“Did you make any of your money in speculation?”</p>

<p>“I never made much money any way, and I never
made any in speculation, or in politics. My political
experience has cost me—not brought me money.”</p>

<p>“How happened you to come to New York?”</p>

<p>“I came to New York as the general manager of the
United States Express Company, and soon after, in
1879, I was elected president, which position I have
held ever since.”</p>

<p>The United States Express Company began business
in 1854, and had in New York City eight wagons and
twenty men, including officers. Its mileage was less
than 600 miles. It now operates 30,000 miles of railroads,
which is a larger mileage than that of any other
single express company in the country. It has ten
thousand employees and five thousand offices. In New
York City alone it has six hundred horses and two
hundred and fifty wagons; and other great cities of the
country are correspondingly well equipped. For a
dozen years the company has had the entire responsibility
of carrying all government money and securities,
except in a few states and territories, and it has transported
hundreds of millions of gold and silver and
paper money without the loss of a penny to the government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
The executive ability, tireless industry, ceaseless
vigilance and courteous and honest dealing of President
T. C. Platt has had much to do with the success of
the company.</p>


<h3>THE ELEMENTS OF SUCCESS.</h3>

<p>“What do you consider essential elements for success
in business?”</p>

<p>“Adaptability to the calling, hard work, strict attention
to business and honest dealing.</p>

<p>“Young men should remember that it is not the
amount made, but that which is saved that indicates
financial success. The habit of economy is important
in getting along in the world.”</p>

<p>“When did you turn your attention to politics?”</p>

<p>“Very early in my history, and I have been in its
seething, boiling steam about ever since. I was first
elected clerk of my county, and soon after was sent to
congress, where I served two terms. I was elected to
the United States senate in 1881, and again two years
ago this last January.”</p>

<p>“It is said that the speech you made on the Treaty of
Paris was your maiden speech in the senate.”</p>

<p>“It was.”</p>

<p>“Why should a man who can make such a speech as
that have been silent so long?”</p>

<p>“I am dragged almost to death with my hard work,
and I have had no time to prepare fine speeches. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
have tried to do my duty in my appropriate sphere as
a representative of my state in the senate.”</p>

<p>“To what do you attribute your political success?”</p>

<p>“To fidelity to the political principles professed, and
especially to my loyalty to my friends.”</p>


<h3>ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN.</h3>

<p>“Would you advise a young man to enter the political
field?”</p>

<p>“By no means! I should advise him to keep out of
it. It is vexatious, unsatisfactory and unremunerative.
I have requested my sons to keep out of politics, and
they have wisely heeded the request.”</p>

<p>“Do you not think that it is the duty of a young man
to hold office or in some way bear his share of the
burdens of state?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do. That is a different thing. I referred
to the undesirable calling of a professional politician.”</p>

<p>“What would you call the essential elements of success
in life?”</p>

<p>“Not one thing, or two things, but a number of
them harmoniously blended, and crowned by a true
sterling character. True success is not in making
money, nor in securing power, nor in winning praise.
It is in the building up of true manhood that merits
and enjoys these things and employs them for the
benefits and happiness of mankind.”</p>

<p>“I forgot to ask you about your health?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“It has never been robust, but it has been good. I
have been very careful in my habits, and have preserved
what bodily energy I needed for my life plans.
Bodily vigor is necessary to the highest success in any
business or profession.”</p>


<h3>MR. PLATT’S CHARACTERISTICS.</h3>

<p>The senator spoke like the courteous gentleman that
he is. His bearing is simplicity and sincerity personified.
He made answer to my questions in a voice as
delicate as a woman’s, giving no hint of the dynamite
behind it. I understand that it is his habit to economize
his strength and use no more on each occasion
than is really required. Mr. Platt is a serious man and
yet he has a deep vein of humor. He likes a good joke
and tells one well. He has a hearty laugh. He has
great patience, but makes a hard fight when provoked.
He is not tyrannical in victory or vengeful in defeat.
He has a knowledge of human nature, a keen insight
into men’s motives, and has skill in playing upon them.
He is a master in adjusting himself to events. He has
a masterful will, but a remarkable faculty also for disarming
instead of exciting antagonism. Altogether he
seems well qualified to be a leader of men.</p>

<h2 class="num">XXI<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Magnate, the Courage of His Convictions
Make Him a Reformer.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>AT the time of the Civil war Tom L. Johnson
was just old enough to begin to realize the
significance of events; he could remember his
family’s former affluence, and this memory
served as a spur to urge him to the rehabilitation of
broken fortunes. At the outbreak of the conflict his
father, A. W. Johnson, had joined the Confederate
army as a colonel, removing his wife and children,
from the Kentucky homestead near Georgetown, to the
south, and finally to Staunton, Virginia, for greater
safety. There the boy Tom, who was born in 1854,
spent four of the most impressionable years of his life,
and there he earned his first dollar.</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST SPECULATION.</h3>

<p>“I am glad I was old enough to remember my home
before the war,” he said, in speaking of his early life.
“Rightly or wrongly, I attach great importance to this
fact as a constant incentive in my career. The thought
of regaining the position which we had previously held
was always with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The five weeks immediately following Lee’s surrender
were a golden time to Tom financially; in that
period, he earned eighty-eight dollars, enough to carry
the family (which consisted of his parents and two
younger brothers), back to Kentucky. This was the
way he did it: There was, of course, great thirst for
news in Staunton, as all over the country, but only once
a day was Staunton in railway communication with the
outside world.</p>

<p>The boy saw his chance for a monopoly in newspapers
and periodicals, and he straightway cornered
the market. This he was enabled to do through the
friendship of the conductor of Staunton’s unique train,
who refused to furnish papers to anyone else. For five
weeks he held his monopoly, selling dailies at fifteen
cents and illustrated periodicals at twenty-five cents
each.</p>

<p>When Johnson ceased to enjoy these exclusive privileges,
he was already a small capitalist, besides having
learned a lesson that was not without profit in after
life. He had eighty-eight dollars in silver.</p>

<p>“I tell you, that seemed like a lot of sure ’nough
money,” he said, with a smile, “to us who had been
paying one hundred dollars in Confederate notes for a
hat.”</p>


<h3>AT WORK IN A ROLLING MILL.</h3>

<p>Three years after he went to work in Louisville as
clerk in an iron rolling mill, on a very small salary. In
the same office with him was another lad, Arthur Moxham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
who later became his business partner. For
economical reasons, the managers of the mill decided
that the services of one of the boys could be dispensed
with, and it then came to a choice between them. Moxham
was the one retained, and Johnson was turned out
to commence over again. At the time, this looked like
a misfortune, but it was really the best thing that could
have happened. Before long, an opening with Louisville’s
ramshackle, broken-down-old-mule street railway
presented itself, and the discharged mill clerk started
on the career which was to lead to fortune.</p>


<h3>A FORTUNATE MISFORTUNE.</h3>

<p>“The decision which retained Moxham in the mill
and turned me adrift,” he said, “was both a wise and a
fortunate one. Moxham was better suited to the position
than I was, and, moreover, I was thus thrown into
the work for which I was adapted.”</p>

<p>Quickly, the boy, who was then nearing manhood,
passed from one place to another in the company’s
service until, after a few years, he became superintendent.
Then he set about building up the railway and
putting it on a paying basis. By a wise system of improving
the accommodations and reducing the expenses,
he was successful in this effort, and he forthwith
began to look around for fresh fields for his ambition.
But, in the meantime, like most men who are
conscious of their strength and ability to cope with the
world, and like many who are not, he had entered upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
matrimony. His bride was his cousin, Miss Margaret
J. Johnson, of Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>At the time of his marriage, Tom L. Johnson was
but twenty, and was just beginning to get a secure footing
in business. But he was not content with his
limited scope of action. Moreover, his employers
wanted to help him forward, recognizing his ability.
Of his own initiative, Biderman Du Pont, one of the
owners of the railway, offered to his <i>protégé a loan of</i>
$30,000, with which to try his fortune. The possibility
of security was, of course, out of the question.</p>

<p>“Take it, Tom,” he said, “and if you live, I know
you’ll pay it back; if you die, why, I’ll be out just so
much. But I’m gambling on your living.”</p>

<p>“And later,” remarked Mr. Johnson, “I had the pleasure
of associating two of Mr. Du Pont’s sons with me
in business matters, and thus enjoyed the satisfaction
of partially repaying his kindness.” With the generous
loan, the young financier organized a triumvirate for
the purchase of the street railways of Indianapolis,
thus taking the first step in the course which led him
in turn to absorb the lines of Cleveland, Detroit, St.
Louis, Brooklyn and other cities. In Indianapolis, he
pursued, with benefit to himself, the system which had
been successful in Louisville,—cheap fares and good
accommodations, with increased transfer privileges.</p>

<p>From that time on his career is an illustration of the
benefits of expansion. The days of the cable and electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
cars came, and the new inventions were immediately
extended to the lines under his control. By that
time he had become strong enough to conduct his
operations independently in his own behalf, or in conjunction
with Moxham,—whose retention in the mill,
by the way, had been but of temporary benefit to him,
owing to the failure of the concern.</p>

<p>Like other practical men who have risen from the
bottom of the ladder, Mr. Johnson familiarized himself
with every detail of his business, even to the mechanical
difficulties involved. This he proved by inventing a
brake for cable-cars, which came into extensive use.</p>


<h3>“PROGRESS AND POVERTY” CHANGED HIS WHOLE LIFE.</h3>

<p>One day, while traveling, Mr. Johnson came across
a book which was destined to influence his career
vitally. This book was Henry George’s “Progress and
Poverty.” There, he thought, was the solution of the
great social questions of the age, and from that moment
he was an ardent “single-taxer.” Indeed, the desire to
benefit his fellowmen by opening their eyes to what he
considered the truth, had become his first consideration
in life, more important even than his business. Forthwith
he set about to convert his father and partner, and
when, soon thereafter, the chance for action on a larger
stage presented itself, he was himself irresistibly impelled
to seize it, despite distrust in his own ability.
Owing to his uniform plan of considering the comfort
of the public in the operation of his railway lines, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
had earned for himself unsought popularity in the city
of Cleveland, where rival companies had practiced a
reactionary system of niggardliness and indifference.
The reward came not only in financial prosperity, but
also in the form of an unexpected nomination to congress.</p>


<h3>HIS VOLUNTEER GERMAN FRIEND.</h3>

<p>News of this honor reached Mr. Johnson while fishing,
and his first impulse was to decline to run. But
further thought led to a change of decision. Having
decided, he acted. From that time until the election,
he delivered a succession of public speeches, and the
man who had distrusted his ability to address an audience
suddenly found that he was an orator.</p>

<p>At every one of his tent meetings was to be seen a
stout old German, who always occupied a front seat,
and who evidently felt a proprietary interest in the
speaker, which he manifested by liberal and loud interjections
of “Bully Boy!” On one occasion, after a
meeting, the German happened to be sitting next to
Miss Johnson in the trolley car on the return trip. “Do
you see that stout man down there?” he said; addressing
her; “well, that’s my friend, Tom Johnson. He’s
a great man; I know him well. And that lady next to
him, that’s his wife.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” replied Miss Johnson, “and I happen to be
his daughter.”</p>

<p>The old German was not one whit abashed. Springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to his feet, he held out his hand. “And I’m delighted
to make your acquaintance, Miss Johnson!” he
cried, at the top of his voice; “I’m delighted to meet
any one belonging to Tom Johnson. Bully boy!”</p>

<p>Like his German admirer, the people stood by Mr.
Johnson, and he was elected a member of the Fifty-second
and Fifty-third Congresses, in which he distinguished
himself by his frank criticism of the administration.</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST SPEECH IN CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Johnson’s account of her husband’s first speech
in Congress is as dramatic and vivid as Baudet’s description
of the trial in the “Nabob.” Like the Nabob’s
mother, she was in attendance unknown to the principal
actor; but, in her case, this was due to intention, not
accident.</p>

<p>“I was alone in the stall of the gallery,” she said,
“save for one other woman, who was there evidently
merely from curiosity. I was choking, trembling from
excitement. There was a great, inarticulate noise in
the chamber, the banging of desk-lids, the calling of
members to pages, the murmur of voices in conversation.
Groups were scattered about the room; members
were reading; no one was paying the slightest attention
to the proceedings. Then Mr. Johnson arose, and I
felt my heart stand still. Surely they would stop the
noise, if only from common courtesy. But there was
not an instant’s cessation in the hubbub; everything
continued exactly as before. He began to speak, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
could hardly catch the sound of his voice. I leaned
forward and gripped the rail; the confusion would distract
him; he would break down. Oh, how I hated
those men who had no consideration for anyone but
themselves. I felt the eyes of the other woman on me,
sympathetically, pitying. Suddenly, someone cried
‘S-sh!’ and there was an instant’s cessation in the noise.
But only for an instant. I was bending forward over
the rail, my eyes fixed on the speaker, hoping, praying
for his success. Suddenly, W. C. Breckenridge, who
was sitting directly in front of him, lifted his eyes and
caught sight of me, and started to rise to come up into
the gallery. I raised my hand and motioned him back,
for I feared Mr. Johnson might look up and see me.
Mr. Breckenridge sank back in his seat again, and I
breathed a sigh of relief.”</p>


<h3>TOM REED LISTENED.</h3>

<p>“Then a wonderful thing happened. A great, massive
figure arose on the Republican side of the house
and came over and took a seat directly in front of the
speaker. He had come over to hear what Mr. Johnson
was saying, and when Tom Reed came across to
listen to a Democrat, everyone else listened, you may
be sure. A hush fell on the house that remained unbroken
until the speaker sat down in a burst of applause.
That was the happiest day of my life.”</p>


<h3>A PEN PICTURE OF TOM JOHNSON.</h3>

<p>Mr. Johnson is short and stout, with clear-cut, strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
features. His face is that of an orator, the eye clear
and direct, the forehead high and commanding. The
broad nose-bridge indicates physical strength, and the
firm mouth and chin, strength of character. In face,
he resembles William Jennings Bryan, but a strong
sense of humor belies deeper resemblance. Unlike most
rich men, he knows when he has enough, and to this
conclusion, it seems, he has now arrived.</p>

<p>“At the age of forty-five,” he said to me, in his apartments
at the Waldorf-Astoria, “I am fortunate enough
to be able to retire from business and to devote myself
to other pursuits. Except for two small matters, I
may be said to be already out of business, and I have
no intention of going into anything new. From now
on I shall give all my energies to spreading the single-tax
theory, either here or in England, where it seems
to be making rapid progress. Exactly how this will be
done, I don’t know. I have always been a Democrat,
and am one still, and I believe in organization; but
whether or not I shall work within party lines, I am
not yet prepared to say. Still, I have my own ideas,
although it is rather my custom to act than to talk in
advance.”</p>

<p>Those who know Mr. Johnson will agree with him,
I think.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Backwoods Boy Works His Way
through College and Becomes
University President.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>AT ten years of age he was a country lad on a
backwoods farm on Prince Edward’s Island.</p>

<p>At thirteen, he had become a clerk in a
country store, at a salary of thirty dollars
a year.</p>

<p>At eighteen, he was a college student, supporting
himself by working in the evenings as a bookkeeper.</p>

<p>At twenty, he had won a scholarship in the University
of London, in competition with all other Canadian
students.</p>

<p>At twenty-five, he was professor of philosophy,
Acadia College, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>At thirty-eight he was appointed President of Cornell
University.</p>

<p>At forty-four, he was chairman of President McKinley’s
special commission to the Philippines.</p>

<p>In this summary is epitomized the career of Jacob
Gould Schurman. It is a romance of real life such as
is not unfamiliar in America. Mr. Schurman’s career
differs from that of some other self-made men, however.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Instead of heaping up millions upon millions, he
has applied his talents to winning the intellectual prizes
of life, and has made his way, unaided, to the front
rank of the leaders in thought and learning in this country.
His career is a source of inspiration to all poor
boys who have their own way to make in the world, for
he has won his present honors by his own unaided
efforts.</p>

<p>President Schurman says of his early life:—</p>

<p>“It is impossible for the boy of to-day, no matter in
what part of the country he is brought up, to appreciate
the life of Prince Edward’s Island as it was forty
years ago. At that time, it had neither railroads nor
daily newspapers, nor any of the dozen other things
that are the merest commonplaces nowadays, even to
the boys of the country districts. I did not see a railway
until late in my ’teens. I was never inside a
theater until after I was twenty. The only newspaper
that came to my father’s house was a little provincial
weekly. The only books the house contained were a
few standard works,—such as the Bible, Bunyan’s ‘Pilgrim’s
Progress,’ Fox’s ‘Book of Martyrs,’ and a few
others of that class. Remember, too, that this was not
back at the beginning of the century, but little more
than a generation ago, for I was born in the year 1854.</p>

<p>“My father had cleared away the land on which our
house stood. He was a poor man, but no poorer than
his neighbors. No amount of land, and no amount of
work could yield much more than the necessaries of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
in that time and place. There were eight children in
our family, and there was work for all of us.</p>

<p>“Our parents were anxious to have their children acquire
at least an elementary education; and so, summer
and winter, we tramped the mile and a half that lay
between our house and the district school, and the snow
often fell to the depth of five or six feet on the island,
and sometimes, when it was at its worst, our father
would drive us all to school in a big sleigh. But no
weather was bad enough to keep us away.</p>

<p>“That would be looked upon as a poor kind of school,
nowadays, I suppose. The scholars were of all ages,
and everything from A,-B,-C, to the Rule of Three, was
taught by the one teacher. But whatever may have been
its deficiencies, the work of the school was thorough.
The teacher was an old-fashioned drillmaster, and
whatever he drove into our heads he put there to stay.
I went to this school summer and winter until I was
thirteen, and by that time I had learned to read and
write and spell and figure with considerable accuracy.</p>

<p>“At the age of thirteen, I left home. I hadn’t formed
any definite plans as to my future. I merely wanted to
get into a village and to earn some money.</p>

<p>“My father got me a place in the nearest town,—Summerside,—a
village of about one thousand inhabitants.
For my first year’s work I was to receive thirty
dollars and my board. Think of that, young men of
to-day! Thirty dollars a year for working from seven
in the morning until ten at night! But I was glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
get the place. It was a start in the world, and the little
village was like a city to my country eyes.”</p>


<h3>HE ALWAYS SUPPORTED HIMSELF.</h3>

<p>“From the time I began working in the store until
to-day, I have always supported myself, and during all
the years of my boyhood I never received a penny that
I did not earn myself. At the end of my first year, I
went to a larger store in the same town, where I was
to receive sixty dollars a year and my board. My salary
was doubled; I was getting on swimmingly.</p>

<p>“I kept this place for two years, and then I gave it
up, against the wishes of my employer, because I had
made up my mind that I wanted to get a better education.
I determined to go to college.</p>

<p>“I did not know how I was going to do this, except
that it must be of my own efforts. I had saved about
eighty dollars from my storekeeping, and that was all
the money I had in the world.</p>

<p>“When I told my employer of my plan, he tried to
dissuade me from it. He pointed out the difficulties in
the way of my going to college, and offered to double
my pay if I would stay in the store.”</p>


<h3>THE TURNING POINT OF HIS LIFE.</h3>

<p>“That was the turning-point in my life. On one side
was the certainty of one hundred and twenty dollars a
year, and the prospect of promotion as fast as I deserved
it. Remember what one hundred and twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
dollars meant in Prince Edward’s Island, and to me, a
poor boy who had never possessed such a sum in his
life. On the other side was my hope of obtaining an
education. I knew that it involved hard work and self-denial,
and there was the possibility of failure in the
end. But my mind was made up. I would not turn
back. I need not say that I do not regret that early
decision, although I think that I would have made a
successful storekeeper.</p>

<p>“With my eighty dollars capital, I began to attend
the village high school, to get my preparation for college.
I had only one year to do it in. My money would
not last longer than that. I recited in Latin, Greek
and algebra, all on the same day, and for the next
forty weeks studied harder than I ever had before or
have since. At the end of the year I entered the competitive
examination for a scholarship in Prince of
Wales College, at Charlotte Town, on the Island. I
had small hope of winning it, my preparation had been
so hasty and incomplete. But when the result was
announced, I found that I had not only won the scholarship
from my county, but stood first of all the competitors
on the Island.</p>

<p>“The scholarship I had won amounted to only sixty
dollars a year. It seems little enough, but I can say
now, after nearly thirty years, that the winning of it
was the greatest success I have ever had. I have had
other rewards, which, to most persons, would seem
immeasurably greater, but with this difference: that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
first success was essential; without it I could not have
gone on. The others I could have done without, if it
had been necessary.”</p>

<p>For two years young Schurman attended Prince
of Wales College. He lived on his scholarship and
what he could earn by keeping books for one of the
town storekeepers, spending less than one hundred
dollars during the entire college year. Afterward, he
taught a country school for a year, and then went to
Acadia College in Nova Scotia to complete his college
course.</p>


<h3>A SPLENDID COLLEGE RECORD.</h3>

<p>One of Mr. Schurman’s fellow-students in Acadia
says that he was remarkable chiefly for taking every
prize to which he was eligible. In his senior year, he
learned of a scholarship in the University of London
offered for competition by the students of Canadian
colleges. The scholarship paid five hundred dollars a
year for three years. The young student in Acadia
was ambitious to continue his studies in England, and
saw in this offer his opportunity. He tried the examination
and won the prize in competition with the
brightest students in the larger Canadian colleges.</p>

<p>During the three years in the University of London,
Mr. Schurman became deeply interested in the study
of philosophy, and decided that he had found in it his
life work. He was eager to go to Germany and study
under the great leaders of philosophic thought. A way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
was opened for him, through the offer of the Hibbard
Society in London, of a traveling fellowship with two
thousand dollars a year. The honor men of the great
English universities like Oxford and Cambridge were
among the competitors, but the poor country boy
from Prince Edward’s Island was again successful,
greatly to the surprise of the others.</p>

<p>At the end of his course in Germany, Mr. Schurman,
then a doctor of philosophy, returned to Acadia College
to become a teacher there. Soon afterward, he
was called to Dalhousie University, at Halifax, Nova
Scotia. In 1886, when a chair of philosophy was established
at Cornell, President White, who had once
met the brilliant young Canadian, called him to that
position. Two years later, Dr. Schurman became Dean
of the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell; and, in
1892, when the president’s chair became vacant, he
was placed at the head of the great university. At
that time, he was only thirty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>President Schurman is a man of great intellectual
power, and an inspiring presence. Though one of the
youngest college presidents in the country, he is one
of the most successful, and under his leadership Cornell
has been very prosperous. He is deeply interested
in all the affairs of young men, and especially those
who, as he did, must make their own way in the world.
He said, the other day:—</p>

<p>“Though I am no longer engaged directly in teaching,
I should think my work a failure if I did not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that my influence on the young men with whom I come
in contact is as direct and helpful as that of a teacher
could be.”</p>


<h3>COLLEGE-BRED MEN ARE IN DEMAND</h3>

<p>“It is true that there is an increasing, and just now,
an unusual demand for college-bred men in all walks
of life. The prescribed preliminaries to legal and
medical education are, step by step, approaching
graduation from college, and have reached it, in some
instances, while these professional courses themselves
have been extended and deepened, till they are now
nearly or quite on a par with the old liberal training
with which they are co-ordinated in the modern university.
As to engineers,—fifteen years ago, the manufacturers
of machinery had to be coaxed to take those
pioneers, the Cornell men, into their shops and give
them a chance. But where one went, many followed.
Last spring, when the class of 1900 came to graduation,
every student in this branch was eagerly bid for
two or three times over. One great electrical firm
alone asked to be given the entire class. There is observable,
too, a gradual increase in the call for college-bred
teachers in the public schools, and this demand
will grow by what it feeds upon.</p>

<p>“All this is but the sign and symbol of an increasing
complexity and organization in our civilization.
Rough-and-ready methods are going out, and the untrained
handy-man with them. In all directions, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
expanding American manufactures and commerce
come into competition with those of Europe, it is
daily more obvious that the higher skill and intelligence,
making the closest use of its resources, will win.
Nowadays, to do the work of the world as the world
will have it done, and will pay for having it done, requires
that a man be trained to the exactitude of scientific
methods, and that he be given the wide mental
outlook and the special training which he can acquire
in the university, and nowhere else.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A “Jack of All Trades” Masters One
and Becomes the Poet of the
People.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY and I were at
breakfast together, and the appearance of his cup
of steaming coffee, into which he hastened to drop
four full-sized blocks of sugar, threw the
“Hoosier” poet into a train of reflections, for which he
presently found expression. “They don’t make coffee
any more,” he observed, in an almost aggrieved tone.
“It is a lost art. You don’t see any more the clear,
transparent beverage that mother used to make. It’s
thick and murky, and, worse than all, it does no good
to protest.”</p>

<p>It was a fortunate circumstance, however, this recalling
a youthful remembrance, for it led him at once into
a lively discussion of that part of his career,—his early
struggles,—which possess for the average person, and
often for the subject himself, far more interest and
fascination than any later triumphs, no matter how
complete. It is doubtful if there is in the literary world,
to-day, a personage whose boyhood and young manhood
can approach in romance and unusual circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that of the author of “The Old Swimmin’
Hole.” It was almost as if it were all a chapter from a
fairy tale, to see the poet sitting there, calm and dignified,
and to listen to his slow speech, in well-modulated
voice, and still attempt to realize of what circumstances
he had been a factor, what experience he had passed
through. All tradition was against his accomplishing
anything in the world. How, indeed, said the good
folks of the little town of Greenfield, Indiana, could
anything be expected of a boy who cared nothing for
school, and deserted it at the first opportunity, to take
up a wandering life.</p>

<p>It is a wonder of wonders that from such a beginning
should spring a poet whose ideals are among the
noblest in American literature. “Ike Walton’s Prayer,”
it would seem, must have been spoken from the poet’s
heart.</p>

<h3>THROWN ON HIS OWN RESOURCES.</h3>

<p>The boy’s father, like almost all fathers, had aspirations.
He wanted the boy to follow in his footsteps, in
the legal profession, and he held out alluring hopes of
the possibility of scaling even greater heights than any
to which he had yet attained. Better still,—from the
standpoint of the restless James,—he took the youngster
with him as he made his circuit from court to court.
These excursions, for they were indeed such to the boy,
sowed deep in his heart the seed of a determination to
become a nomad, and it was not long until he started
out as a strolling sign-painter, determined upon the
realization of his ideals. Oftentimes business was
worse than dull, and, on one occasion, hunger drove
him for recourse to his wits, and lo, he blossomed forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
as a “blind sign-painter,” led from place to place by a
little boy, and showered with sympathy and trade in
such abundance that he could hardly bear the thought
of the relinquishment of a pretense so ingenious and
successful, entered on at first as a joke.</p>

<p>Then came another epoch. The young man fell in
with a patent-medicine man, with whom he joined fortunes,
and here the young Indianian, who had been
scribbling more or less poetry ever since he first essayed
to compose a four-line valentine upon a writing table
whose writing surface was almost as high as his head,
found a new use for his talent, for his duties in the partnership
were to beguile the people with joke and song,
while his co-worker plied the sales of his cure-all; and,
forsooth, there were many times when, but for his
poetic fancy, Riley might have seen his audience dwindle
rapidly away. It was while thus engaged that he
had the opportunities which enabled him to master
thoroughly the “Hoosier” dialect. When the glamour
of the patent-medicine career had faded somewhat,
Riley joined a band of strolling Thespians, and, in this
brief portion of his life, after the wont of players of his
class, played many parts. At length he began to give a
little more attention to his literary work, and, later, obtained
a place on an Indianapolis paper, where he published
his first poems, and be it said that they won their
author almost instant success.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHY HE LONGED TO BE A BAKER.</h3>

<p>When I drew Riley out to talk still further of those
interesting days, and the strange experiences which
came to him therein, the conversation finally turned on
the subject of his youthful ambitions. “I think my
earliest remembered one,” he said, “was an insatiate
longing to become a baker. I don’t know what
prompted it, unless it was the vision of the mountains
of alluring ‘goodies,’ which, as they are ranged in
the windows of the pastry shops, appear doubly tempting
to the youth whose mother not only counsels
moderation, but enforces it.</p>

<p>“Next, I imagined that I would like to become a
showman of some sort, and then my shifting fancy conjured
up visions of how grand it would be to work as a
painter, and decorate houses and fences in glowing
colors, but finally, as I grew a little older, there returned
my old longing to become an actor. When, however,
my dreams were realized, and I became a member of a
traveling theatrical company, I found that the life was
full of hardships, with very little chances of rising in
the world. I never had any literary ambition whatever,
so far as I can remember. I wrote, primarily, simply
because I desired to have something to read, and could
not find selections that exactly suited me. Gradually I
found a demand for my little efforts springing up, and
so my brother, who could write legibly, transcribed
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SUPERSTRUCTURE DEPENDS ON THE FOUNDATION.</h3>

<p>“Mr. Riley,” I said, “I came here to see you to-day
in behalf of the thousands of people who are seeking to
make progress, or gain a start in business or professional
life, and I suppose that the tastes of some of them
incline to the literary field. Can’t you give me your idea
of the prime requisites for success in the field of letters?”</p>

<p>“The most essential factor is persistence,—the determination
never to allow your energy or enthusiasm to
be dampened by the discouragements that must inevitably
come. I believe that he is richer for the battle with
the world, in any vocation, who has great determination
and little talent, rather than his seemingly more fortunate
brother with great talent, perhaps, but little determination.
As for the field of literature, I cannot but
express my conviction that meteoric flights, such as
have been taken, of recent years, by some young writers
with whose names almost everybody is familiar, cannot
fail to be detrimental, unless the man to whom success
comes thus early and suddenly is an exceptionally
evenly-balanced and sensible person. Many persons
have spoken to me about Kipling’s work, and remarked
how wonderful a thing is the fact that such achievements
could have been possible for a man comparatively
so young. I say, not at all. What do we find
when we investigate? Simply that Kipling began
working on a newspaper when he was only thirteen
years of age, and he has been toiling ever since. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
you see, even that case, when we get at the inner facts,
confirms my theory that every man must be ‘tried in the
fire,’ as it were. He may begin early or late, and in
some cases the fight is longer than in others, but of one
thing I feel sure, that there is no short-cut to permanent,
self-satisfying success in literature, or anything
else.”</p>


<h3>A LITERARY LIFE MEANS WORK.</h3>

<p>When he was asked for his opinion on the subject of
the expansion of Indiana literature, Mr. Riley said:—</p>

<p>“I do not know what I should say about Indiana
literature and the causes of its growth. I think, possibly,
the reason it has attracted such wide attention, and
expanded in so many directions, is that it drew inspiration
and received impetus from having been lampooned
and made fun of by every cultured ‘Tom, Dick, and
Harry’ of the outside world.</p>

<p>“Personally, the world has always been kind to me,
but I do not know that I expected kindness.</p>

<p>“It is glorious to be barred,—to suffer the whips and
scorn of self-accredited superiors! It roused us, this
superciliousness, to our real worth, and it inspired us
to put forth our best efforts. That excellence in literature
is found in Indiana I am thankful for, and I am
glad that I have outlived the ridicule, and that others
have recognized, of late, this special excellence of the
work of our authors, and given credit most generously.</p>

<p>“I am sure that the same excellence will be found in
our neighboring western states, and that we, in turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
will not withhold from them encouragement and recognition.
Illinois has already developed some rare poets.
Ohio, too, ranks high in western literature.</p>

<p>“The beginner, with his youthful imagination just
‘ramping it,’ is too sensitive to the pricks of criticism.
He stands in awe of the self-constituted critic, until he
cannot see anything else, and, necessarily, loses sight of
the value of ideas, which count more than all else. He
can never make up the loss in years. Indeed, he can
never regain it. It is expecting to be a writer in six
months or a year that makes him think himself a
failure.</p>

<p>“A literary life means work. He who would write
must learn that, and learn to work hard. Look at Bernhardt’s
art; look at the amount of hard work she goes
through every day to make it perfect. How many
writers do as she does? No good thing was ever done
quickly,—nothing of any value. The capacity for hard
work has had much to do with the development of
Indiana literature.”</p>


<h3>A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS AN ADVANTAGE.</h3>

<p>Answering other questions, the poet said: “A college
education for the aspirant for literary success is, of
course, an advantage, provided he does not let education
foster a false culture that will lead him away from
his true ideals and the ideals he ought to cling to.
There is another thing that the young man in any artistic
pursuit must have a care for, and that is, to be practical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
This is a practical world, and it is always ready
to take advantage of this sort of people, so that if he
wishes what we might call domestic happiness, he might
as well make up his mind to a dual existence, as it were,
and must try to cultivate a practical business sense, as
well as an artistic sense. We have only a few men like
Rudyard Kipling and F. Hopkinson Smith, who seem
to combine these diverse elements of character in just
the right proportions, but I believe that it is unfortunate
for the happiness and peace of mind of our authors
and artists and musicians that we have not more of
them.”</p>

<p>Riley’s poetry is popular because it goes right to the
feelings of the people. He could not have written as
he does, but for the schooling of that wandering life,
which gave him an insight into the struggle for existence
among the great unnumbered multitude of his fellow
men. He learned in his travels and journeys, in his
hard experience as a strolling sign-painter and patent-medicine
peddler, the freemasonry of poverty. His
poems are natural; they are those of a man who feels
as he writes. As Thoreau painted nature in the woods,
and streams, and lakes, so Riley depicts the incidents
of everyday life, and brightens each familiar lineament
with that touch that makes all the world kin. One of
his noblest poems is “Old Glory.” It speaks the homely,
sterling patriotism of the common people.</p>

<p>“The Little Coat” illustrates his wonderful power to
touch the heart.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THE international discussion of “The Man with
the Hoe” had hardly subsided, when popular
interest was revived by the remarkable
declaration of the author, Mr. Edwin Markham,
that he had spent ten years in its production.</p>

<p>Who is this magician of the pen, this man of mystery,
who carries his readers, in a single sentence,
through “a storm of stars,” and, in another, kneels
with them in dreamy sympathy beside “the brother to
the ox,”—who mixes up the critics in a hopeless tangle
of doubt, and puzzles the public by the erratic chronology
of his mental processes?</p>

<h3>ONE OF THE GREAT POEMS OF THE CENTURY.</h3>

<p>No other poem published in America in many years
has so stirred the emotions of the people, commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
so much attention and created so much comment as
“The Man with the Hoe.” It and Kipling’s “Recessional”
are regarded as the great poems of the closing
years of the century. The critics have hailed “The
Man with the Hoe” as a prominent piece of political
literature, because of the breadth and depth and vital
importance of the theme, and the fervor and noble
dignity of its treatment. Yet the poem has been misinterpreted
and assailed. It has been said to be an
affront to manual labor. The only answer Mr. Markham
has thus far made to his critics he dictated to the
writer. He also spoke, for the first time for publication,
of his mother, and her all-pervading influence on
his early life, of his youthful days, and of his own
experience with the hoe.</p>

<p>Mr. Markham’s poetry proves that his paramount
quality is his deep sympathy with suffering. The most
marked thing in his personality is his humanity, which
effuses, so to speak, in a spontaneous geniality and unaffected
interest in others. He laughs easily and tells
a story extremely well.</p>


<h3>HIS MOTHER WAS BOTH PRACTICAL AND POETIC.</h3>

<p>“I am a very serious man at heart,” he remarked to
me, “but, fortunately, I have a sense of humor. I will
confess that the attention attracted by ‘The Man with
the Hoe’ has surprised me, and the comments of some
of the gentlemen who have condescended to criticise
the poem are amusing. They seem to miss entirely its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
true spirit and meaning, and yet speak with most complacent
confidence. I,— O, you want me to start at
the beginning of my life and proceed in an orderly
manner, do you? Well, I have said little for print
about my early days, but get out your pencil and I will
dictate you something.</p>

<p>“That most important event, my birth, occurred in
Oregon City, Oregon, on April 23, 1852. My schooling
began when I was about four years old, in a primitive
little school in my native town.</p>

<p>“While he instilled in my youthful mind the principles
of the alphabet and other important knowledge,
it was the influence of my mother,—my father having
died,—that dominated me. She was, in some respects,
the most extraordinary woman I have ever known,—a
woman of strong likes and dislikes, and capable of
holding on to a purpose to the end. She kept a large
store of general merchandise in Oregon City, and conducted
the business with remarkable energy. But,
despite her hard common sense and practical ability,
she was known as the ‘Woman Poet of Oregon.’ It
was from her, of course, that I got my own poetical
bent. Her poetry was full of feeling and earnestness,
and was impressed with a strong religious spirit. It
was published chiefly in newspapers at the time, and I
presume I am the only person in the world who now
has any of it.”</p>


<h3>HE GAINED VALUABLE DISCIPLINE ON A FARM.</h3>

<p>“When I was still a small boy, mother moved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
California. She settled in a little wild valley amid
the hills in the central part of the state, on a sheep
range that she had bought. I was chief herder.
All day long I followed the herd over ridge and hollow,
and along the hillsides into the blue distance. I absorbed
woodcraft and weather-wit, and a love of nature
which has been one of the predominating influences
of my life.</p>

<p>“After a few years, we turned our place into a
cattle range and farm, with myself as chief farmer. I
was just entering my ‘teens’ then. I fenced and
plowed the land straggling up the little valley, and
learned every detail of a farmer’s work and life. The
hoe, the shovel, the scythe, the cradle, the reaper, the
threshing machine, the grafting knife,—these are all
old friends of mine. When I began to near young
manhood, I became a thresher, going from farm to
farm, helping to thresh out the grain after the harvest
home, and often sleeping at night in hay-mows.</p>


<h3>BYRON’S POEMS INSPIRED HIM.</h3>

<p>“Meanwhile, I devoured all the poetry I could find.
I read Byron’s poems more than any other’s, because a
complete set of his works was at hand, and as a result
of his influence I wrote, when about sixteen, a very
ambitious poem called, ‘A Dream of Chaos.’ This was
only one of my youthful indiscretions in the poetical
line. No, I don’t believe the general public will ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
be asked to read them. It has been kind to me, and
deserves fair treatment.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Markham, did you not find that your hard
farm labor tended to crush out the poetry, and finer
feelings generally?”</p>


<h3>ANSWERING HIS CRITICS.</h3>

<p>“Oh, you are now getting on ticklish ground, for it
is here that the critics of ‘The Man with the Hoe’ congregate
and jubilate. Let me say briefly, though, in
answer to you and to them, that I believe in labor, that
I believe in its humanizing and redeeming power. Indeed,
from a religious point of view, I believe that a
man’s craft furnishes the chief basis of his redemption.
While one is making a house, he is making himself.
While he chisels the block of marble he is invisibly
shaping his own soul. And it does not matter much
what a man does,—whether he builds a poem or hoes
in a garden. The chief thing is the way we do our
work. It must be done thoroughly, and in the spirit
of loving service. Work of this order is a perpetual
prayer. The doer is elevated by such work.</p>

<p>“But, while all this is true, it is also true that excesses
are evils,—that overwork and underpaid work
tend to break down instead of build up. Work is good
for the child, but I can put such heavy burdens upon
him as to deform his body and stunt his mind.</p>

<p>“‘The Man with the Hoe’ is, of course, the type of
industrial oppression in all lands and in all parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
labor. He is the man who has been chained to the
wheel by the fierce necessity for bread,—the man with
no time for rest, no time for study, no time for thought,
no time for the mighty hopes that make us men. The
poem is not a protest against labor; it is a protest
against the degradation of labor.”</p>


<h3>SEED SOWN LONG AGO.</h3>

<p>Speaking of the writing of this poem, Mr. Markham
said that he sketched the outline of it fourteen
years ago, upon seeing a photograph of Millet’s famous
painting, “The Man with the Hoe.” When he saw the
picture itself four years afterward, he further elaborated
the idea, but did not write it out in complete form
until Christmas week, 1900. He then spent three or
four days on it, and sent it to the San Francisco Examiner,
where it was published for the first time on
the eighth of January 1901.</p>

<p>Within a few months, the volume, “The Man with
the Hoe and other Poems,” was issued by Doubleday
and McClure, of New York, and met with so large
a sale that it was soon in its fifth edition. It has been
very favorably received.</p>

<p>Mr. Markham paid his way through the state normal
school at San Jose, and afterward through Christian
college at Santa Rosa, California. He has done
important educational work in that state as a superintendent
and principal of schools in various places, and
is now head master of the Tompkins observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
school in Oakland. Inducements have been offered
him to deliver a series of lectures throughout the country,
and he has received many requests for literary
work, with some of which he will comply.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Famous Authoress Tells Literary
Aspirants the Story of Her
Struggle for Recognition.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>BORN and reared in Wisconsin, Ella Wheeler
Wilcox, although a resident of New York, is
still faithful to the ideals and aspirations of the
young and vigorous western state in which she
first saw the light. She began writing at an early age,
and still has in her possession childish verses, composed
when she was only eight years old.</p>

<p>She was, however, far from any literary center; she
had no one upon whom she might rely for advice as
to her methods, and she had no influential friends, for
her family was not a wealthy one. The usual difficulties,
so familiar to all beginners, met her at every step;
discouragements were endured day after day, and year
after year. After a while, she began writing for
various periodicals. Her first poems appeared in the
New York Mercury, the Waverly Magazine, and
Leslie’s publications. It was from the publishing house
of Frank Leslie she received her first check. Her income
from literary work was very small and recognition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
came quite slowly. But courage, and patience,
and fortitude, finally won the day.</p>


<h3>HOW HER BEST POEMS WERE WRITTEN.</h3>

<p>One of her most famous poems, beginning, “Laugh
and the World Laughs with You,” was written about
February, 1883, at Madison, Wisconsin. She had
talked with a friend who had been bereaved by death in
her household; later, while dressing for an inaugural
ball, given in honor of the governor of Wisconsin, she
was startled to think how soon the mind turns from
stories of sorrow to scenes of gayety. Thus she
formed the idea of this famous poem. It originally
appeared in the New York Sun, and the author received
five dollars for it. Subsequently, an attempt was
made to pirate the verses as the composition of another;
but the effort was, happily, a complete failure.
The poem embodying the idea,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A question is never settled</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Until it is settled right,”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>with which W. J. Bryan concludes his book, was written
by her after hearing a gentleman make a remark
in those words at the conclusion of a heated argument,
on the single-tax question. The gentleman was afterward
told that Lincoln had made use of this exact
expression, years ago. But neither the gentleman in
question, nor Mrs. Wilcox herself, had ever heard the
expression before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Two Glasses,” one of her brightest poems,
was written at the age of eighteen. Although this was
a “temperance poem,” she had never, up to that time,
seen a glass of beer or wine. This poem, too, was
pirated by one who pretended to be the author.</p>

<p>“The Birth of the Opal” was suggested by Herman
Marcus, the Broadway jeweler, who advanced the idea
of the opal being the child of the sunlight and moonlight.</p>

<p>“Wherever You Are,” originally appeared in Leslie’s
Popular Monthly. A young man who had served
a term in Auburn Prison read this poem, and it became
the means of his reformation. Mrs. Wilcox lent him
a helping hand, and he is to-day a hard-working,
honest, worthy man.</p>

<p>She regards the poems, “High Noon,” “To An Astrologer,”
and “The Creed,” as probably her best
efforts. It will thus be noted that she does not prefer
the more fervid poems of passion, written in her early
youth.</p>

<div class="verse">And strengthens hope and scatters joy abroad,</div>
<div class="verse">He, too, is a Redeemer, Son of God.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mrs. Wilcox lives in New York City from November
to May, and in her cottage at Short Beach, Connecticut,
during the rest of the year. Her husband,
R. M. Wilcox, is a clear-headed business man, of polished
manners, kind and considerate to all whom he
meets,—one who, in short, is deservedly popular with
all the friends of the happy couple. The summer house
at Short Beach is especially charming. It is in full
view of the Long Island Sound, with a fine beach in
front, and a splendid sweep of country at the rear.</p>


<h3>SHE IS A PRONOUNCED OPTIMIST.</h3>

<p>As to “literary methods,” Mrs. Wilcox has few
suggestions to make, except to recommend hard work,
conscientiously performed. She is untiring in her own
efforts at rewriting, revising and polishing her productions,
and cannot rest until every appearance of
crudeness and carelessness is effaced. Her manuscripts
are always neat, always carefully considered, and never
prepared in undue haste. She believes that no writer
can succeed who is a pessimist. She is, therefore, an
optimist of the most pronounced type, and believes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
all poems should be helpful not hurtful; full of hope,
and not of despair; bright with faith, and not clouded
by doubt.</p>

<p>“What is your view of the first duties of a young
author?” she was asked, and replied:</p>

<p>“The first thing necessary for you to do is to find
out your own motive in choosing a literary career. If
you write as the young bird sings, you need no advice
from me, for your thoughts will find their way out, as
natural springs force their way through rocks, and
nothing can hinder you. But if you have merely a
well-defined literary ability and taste, you should consider
carefully before undertaking the difficult task of
authorship.</p>

<p>“An author should be able to instruct, entertain,
guide or amuse his readers. Otherwise, he has no
right to expect their attention, time or money. If it is
merely a question of money, you would be wise to wait
until you have a comfortable income, sufficient to maintain
life during the first ten years of literary pursuits.
Save in rare cases of remarkable genius, literature requires
ten years of apprenticeship, at least, before
yielding support to its followers. But be sure that
you help,—not harm, humanity. To the author, of all
men, belongs the motto, ‘<i>Noblesse oblige</i>.’”</p>


<h3>DO NOT FEAR CRITICISM.</h3>

<p>“Unless you are so absorbed in your work that you
utterly forget the existence of critics or reviewers, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
have no right to call yourself a genius. Talent thinks
with fear and fawning of critics; genius does not remember
that they exist. One bows at the shrine of
existing public opinion, which is narrow with prejudice.
The other bows at the shrine of art, which is as
broad as the universe.”</p>

<p>“How do you think a young author should proceed
to obtain recognition?”</p>

<p>“In regard to the practical method of getting one’s
work before the public, I would beg that you would not
send it to any well-known author, asking him or her to
‘read, criticize, correct, and find a publisher for you.’
If such a thought has entered your head, remember
that it has entered the heads of five hundred other
amateurs, and the poor author is crushed under an
avalanche of badly-written manuscripts, not one of
which he has time to read. No editor will accept what
he does not want, through the advice of any author,
however famous.</p>

<p>“Do not attempt to adopt the style of anyone else.
Unless you feel that you can be yourself, do not try
to be anybody. A poor original is better than a good
imitation, in literature, if not in other things.</p>

<p>“Expect no aid from influential friends in any way.
The more wholly you depend upon yourself, the sooner
will you succeed.</p>

<p>“It is absolute nonsense to talk about ‘influence’ with
editors or publishers. No one ever achieved even passing
fame or success in literature through influence or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
‘friends at court.’ An editor might be influenced to
accept one article, but he would never give permanent
patronage through any influence, however strong.</p>

<p>“As I receive so many hundreds of letters asking
how I found my way into print, and through what influences,
it may be pardonable for me to say a few
words regarding my own experiences. In the first
place, I never sent a manuscript to any human being
in my life, to ask for an opinion or influence. I always
send directly to the editors, and I am not aware that
any influence was ever used in my behalf. I have often
had an article refused by six editors and accepted by
the seventh. An especially unfortunate manuscript of
mine was once rejected by eight periodicals, and I was
about to consign it to oblivion, when, at a last venture,
I sent it to the ninth. A check of seventy-five dollars
came to me by return mail, with an extremely complimentary
letter from the editor, requesting more articles
of a similar kind.”</p>


<h3>MERIT IS NOT ALWAYS DISCOVERED QUICKLY.</h3>

<p>“Very few authors have lived to attain any degree of
fame without receiving back their cherished yet unwelcome
manuscripts from the hands of one or more unappreciative
editors before they met the public eye.</p>

<p>“It is reported of ‘David Harum’ that six publishers
rejected it previous to its final publication.</p>

<p>“Archibald Gunter’s book, ‘Mr. Barnes of New
York,’ went the rounds of the various publishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
houses, only to be rejected by all. Then Mr. Gunter
rose to the occasion, published it himself, and reaped a
small fortune from its sales.</p>

<p>“Many a successful short story and poem passes
through the ‘reading’ department of a half-dozen
magazines and weeklies without having its merit discovered
until a seventh editor accepts it.</p>

<p>“Poems of my own, which have later met much favor
from the public, I have seen return with a dejected and
dog-eared air, from eight or nine offices, whither they
had gone forth, like Noah’s dove, seeking for a resting
place. A charming bit of verse, written by a friend
of mine, took twenty-one journeys from the maternal
hand to the editor’s table before it found an appreciative
purchaser.</p>

<p>“If the young writer will stop and consider that each
editor has his own individual ideas of what he wants,
both in verse and prose, and that, just as no two faces
are alike, no two minds run in the same groove,—he
may be hopeful for the ultimate acceptance of the
darling of his brain, if he will persevere. Of course,
this refers to a writer who possesses actual talent.”</p>


<h3>EDITORS ARE ANXIOUS FOR GOOD ARTICLES.</h3>

<p>“No more absurd idea ever existed than that of the
efficacy of ‘influence’ in literature. An editor will buy
what he thinks his readers will appreciate. He will
not buy anything which he feels will fall dead on his
audience. He may purchase one—possibly two, manuscripts,—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
oblige a friend, but it will end there; and
one or two manuscripts, so purchased, can never make
name or fame for their author.</p>

<p>“It would be just as reasonable to talk about ‘influence
with a dry-goods merchant,’ and to expect to
make him purchase undesired goods from a manufacturer
for friendship’s sake, as to think an editor can
be influenced by a friend at court.</p>

<p>“Editors are employed by the owners of periodicals
to select and publish material which will render the
periodical a paying concern. The editor who does not
do this may lose his position and his salary.</p>

<p>“He is on the watch for attractive matter—and desires
to find new material. He is delighted when he
discovers a new poet or author. Being mortal, and
having but one mind, he can judge of the poems and
stories sent to him only from an individual standpoint.</p>

<p>“He not infrequently lets genius slip through his
hands, and accepts paste imitations. But he does it
ignorantly, or carelessly, not wilfully; or he may have
in his collection of accepted manuscripts something
similar, which would prevent his use of a poem or
sketch at that particular juncture.</p>

<p>“The reasons why an editor declines a good manuscript
are innumerable. It is impossible for him to
explain them to each applicant for his favor. Nothing
indicates the crudity of an author more than a request
to criticize a manuscript and point out its defects; for
frequently the very first verse or the very first page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of a poem or romance decides its fate, and the editor
returns it without reading further. Sometimes its
length prevents any possibility of its being used in that
particular periodical, while it might be just what another
magazine would desire.”</p>


<h3>PERSEVERANCE COUNTS IN AUTHORSHIP.</h3>

<p>“The young writer who decides absolutely upon a
literary career, and is confident of his mental equipment
for his profession, should read all the current
periodicals, magazines, and weeklies, American and
English, and observe what style of literature they publish.
Then he should make a list of them, and send
his poem or his narrative first to the magazine which
he feels it is best suited for; if it returns, let him proceed
to speed it forth again, after giving it another
reading; and so on, until it has finished the circuit of,
perhaps, fifty periodicals. This habit of perseverance
will be worth something, even if he never sells that
manuscript.</p>

<p>“If he is still confident of his powers, let him write
in another vein, and proceed in the same manner. This
persistency, backed by talent, must win in the long run.</p>

<p>“If he feels he wants criticism, let him apply to some
of the literary bureaus which make a business of criticism
and revision.</p>

<p>“Very few authors have time to give to this work,
nor are they, as a rule, the best judges of the merit of
another writer’s productions. After all, the secret of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a writer’s success lies within him. If he is well
equipped, he will win, but not otherwise.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Printer’s Boy, Self Taught, Becomes
the Dean of American
Letters.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>“I &nbsp; SHOULD like, Mr. Howells,” said I, by way
of opening my interview with the famous
novelist, “to learn your opinion concerning
what constitutes success in life. You should
have the American view?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” said the novelist, seating himself.</p>

<p>“Do you share the belief that everything is open to
the beginner who has sufficient energy and perseverance?”</p>

<p>“Add brains, and I will agree,” said Mr. Howells
with a smile. “A young man stands at the ‘parting of
two ways,’ and can take his path this way or that. It
is comparatively easy then, with good judgment. Youth
is certainly the greatest advantage which life supplies.”</p>

<p>“You began to carve out your place in life under conditions
very different from those of to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was born in a little southeastern Ohio village,—Martin’s
Ferry,—and, of course, I had but little
of what people deem advantages in the way of schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
railroads, population, and so on. I am not sure, however,
that compensation was not had in other things.”</p>

<p>“Do you consider that you were specially talented in
the direction of literary composition?”</p>

<p>“I should not say that. I think that I came of a reading
race, which had always loved literature in a way.
My inclination was to read.”</p>

<p>“Would you say that, with a special leaning toward a
special study, and good health, a fair start, and perseverance,
anyone can attain to distinction?”</p>


<h3>EARLY IDEALS.</h3>

<p>“That is a probability, only. You may be sure that
distinction will not come without those qualities. The
only way to succeed, therefore, is to have them; though
having them will not necessarily guarantee distinction.
I can only say that I began with a lofty ideal, without
saying how closely I have held to it. My own youth
was not specially marked by advantages. There were
none, unless you can call a small bookcase full of books,
which my home contained, an advantage. The printing
office was my school from a very early date. My father
thoroughly believed in it, and he had his belief as to
work, which he illustrated as soon as we were old
enough to learn the trade he followed. We could go to
school and study, or we could go into the printing office
and work, with perhaps an equal chance of learning;
but we could not be idle.”</p>

<p>“And you chose the printing office?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not wholly. As I recall it, I went to and fro between
the schoolhouse and the printing office. When I
tired of one, I was promptly given my choice of the
other.”</p>

<p>“Then you began life in poverty?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that, as the world goes now, we were poor.
My father’s income was never above twelve hundred a
year, and his family was large; but nobody was rich
then. We lived in the simple fashion of that time and
place.”</p>

<p>“You found time to read?”</p>

<p>“My reading, somehow, went on pretty constantly.
No doubt my love for it won me a chance to devote
time to it.”</p>

<p>“Might I ask how much time you devoted each day
to your literary object?”</p>

<p>“The length varied with varying times. Sometimes
I read but little. There were years of the work, of the
over-work, indeed,—which falls to the lot of many, that
I should be ashamed to speak of except in accounting
for the fact. My father had sold his paper in Hamilton,
and had bought an interest in another at Dayton,
and at that time we were all straining our utmost to
help pay for it.”</p>

<p>“And that left you little time?”</p>

<p>“In that period very few hours were given to literature.
My daily tasks began so early, and ended so late,
that I had little time, even if I had the spirit for reading.
Sometimes I had to sit up until midnight, waiting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
telegraphic news, and be up again at dawn to deliver
the papers, working afterward at the case; but that
was only for a few years.”</p>

<p>“When did you find time to seriously apply yourself
to literature?”</p>


<h3>ACQUIRING A LITERARY STYLE.</h3>

<p>“I think I did so before I really had the time. Literary
aspirations were stirred in me by the great authors
whom I successively discovered, and I was perpetually
imitating the writings of these,—modeling some composition
of my own after theirs, but never willing to
own it.”</p>

<p>“Do you attribute your style to the composite influence
of these various models?”</p>

<p>“No doubt they had their effect, as a whole, but individually
I was freed from the last by each succeeding
author, until at length I came to understand that I must
be like myself, and no other.”</p>

<p>“Had you any conveniences for literary research,
beyond the bookcase in your home?”</p>

<p>“If you mean a place to work, I had a narrow, little
space, under the stairs at home. There was a desk
pushed back against the wall, which the irregular ceiling
sloped down to meet, behind it, and at my left was
a window, which gave a good light on the writing leaf
of my desk. This was my workshop for six or seven
years,—and it was not at all a bad one. It seemed, for
a while, so very simple and easy to come home in the
middle of the afternoon, when my task at the printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
office was done, and sit down to my books in my little
study, which I did not finally leave until the family
were all in bed. My father had a decided bent in the
direction of literature; and, when I began to show a
liking for literature, he was eager to direct my choice.
This finally changed to merely recommending books,
and eventually I was left to my own judgment,—a perplexed
and sorrowful mistaken judgment, at times.”</p>

<p>“In what manner did you manage to read the works
of all your favorite authors?”</p>

<p>“Well, my hours in the printing office began at seven
and ended at six, with an hour at noon for dinner,
which I used for putting down such verses as had come
to me in the morning. As soon as supper was over, I
got out my manuscripts, and sawed, and filed, and hammered
away at my blessed poems, which were little less
than imitations, until nine, when I went regularly to
bed, to rise again at five. Sometimes the foreman gave
me an afternoon off on Saturday, which I devoted to
literature.”</p>

<p>“Might I ask concerning your next advance in your
chosen work?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. As I recall it, my father had got one of
those legislative clerkships, in 1858, which used to fall
sometimes to deserving country editors, and together
we managed and carried out a scheme for corresponding
with some city papers. Going to Columbus, the
state capital, we furnished a daily letter giving an
account of the legislative proceedings, which I mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
wrote from the material he helped me to gather. The
letters found favor, and my father withdrew from the
work wholly.”</p>

<p>“How long were you a correspondent?”</p>


<h3>HIS POEMS ALWAYS WERE REJECTED.</h3>

<p>“Two years. At the end of the first winter, a Cincinnati
paper offered me the city editorship, but one
night’s round with the reporters at the police station
satisfied me that I was not meant for that kind of work.
I then returned home for the summer, and spent my
time in reading, and in sending off poems, which regularly
came back. I worked in my father’s printing
office, of course; but, as soon as my task was done,
went home to my books, and worked away at them
until supper. Then a German bookbinder, with whom I
was endeavoring to read Heine in the original, met me
in my father’s editorial room, and with a couple of candles
on the table between us, and our Heine and the dictionary
before us, we read until we were both tired out.”</p>

<p>“Did you find it labor?”</p>

<p>“I fancy that reading is not merely a pastime, when
it is apparently the merest pastime. It fatigues one
after the manner of other work, and uses up a certain
amount of mind-stuff; and I have found that, if you are
using up all the mind-stuff you have, much or little, in
some other way, you do not read, because you have not
the mind-stuff for it. You cannot say more of any
other form of work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then it might be said that you worked at separate
and equally difficult tasks, constantly?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not equally difficult, but, certainly, constantly.”</p>

<p>“Rather a severe schooling to give one’s self, don’t
you think it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Howells smiled. “It was not without its immediate
use. I learned how to choose between words, after
a study of their fitness; and, though I often employed
them decoratively, and with no vital sense of their
qualities, still, in mere decoration, they had to be chosen
intelligently, and after some thought about their structure
and meaning. I would not imitate great writers
without imitating their method, which was to the last
degree intelligent. They knew what they were doing,
and, although I did not always know what I was doing,
they made me wish to know, and ashamed of not knowing.
The result was beneficial.”</p>

<p>“It is very evident that you recovered your health, in
spite of your toil?”</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST EDITORIAL POSITION.</h3>

<p>“Oh, yes. I got back health enough to be of use in
the printing office at home, and was quietly at work
there, when, to my astonishment, I was asked to come
and take a place upon a Republican newspaper at the
capital. I was given charge of the news department.
This included the literary notices and the book reviews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and I am afraid that I at once gave my prime attention
to these.”</p>

<p>“When did you begin to contribute to the literature
of the day?”</p>

<p>“If you mean, when did I begin to attempt to contribute,
I should need to fix an early date, for I early
had experience with rejected manuscripts. One of my
pieces, which fell so far short of my visions of the immense
subjects I should handle as to treat of the lowly
and familiar theme of spring, was the first thing I ever
had in print. My father offered it to the editor of the
paper I worked on in Columbus, where we were then
living, and I first knew what he had done when, with
mingled shame and pride, I saw it in the journal. In
the tumult of my emotions, I promised myself that if
ever I got through that experience safely, I would
never suffer anything else of mine to be published; but
it was not long before I offered the editor a poem,
myself.”</p>

<p>“When did you publish your first story?”</p>

<p>“My next venture was a story in the Ik Marvel manner,
which it was my misfortune to carry into print. I
did not really write it, but composed it, rather, in type,
at the case. It was not altogether imitated from Ik
Marvel, for I drew upon the easier art of Dickens, at
times, and helped myself out in places with bald parodies
of’Bleak House.’ It was all very well at the beginning,
but I had not reckoned with the future sufficiently
to start with any clear ending in my mind; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as I went on, I began to find myself more and more in
doubt about it. My material gave out; my incidents
failed me; the characters wavered, and threatened to
perish in my hands. To crown my misery, there grew
up an impatience with the story among its readers; and
this found its way to me one day, when I overheard an
old farmer, who came in for his paper, say that he ‘did
not think that story amounted to much.’ I did not think
so, either, but it was deadly to have it put into words;
and how I escaped the mortal effect of the stroke I do
not know. Somehow, I managed to bring the wretched
thing to a close, and to live it slowly down.”</p>


<h3>AN EXPERIENCE IN COLLABORATION.</h3>

<p>“My next contribution to literature was jointly with
John J. Piatt, the poet, who had worked with me as a
boy in the printing office at Columbus. We met in
Columbus, where I was then an editor, and we made
our first literary venture together in a volume entitled,
‘Poems of Two Friends.’ The volume became instantly
and lastingly unknown to fame; the west waited,
as it always does, to hear what the east should say.
The east said nothing, and two-thirds of the small
edition of five hundred copies came back upon the publisher’s
hands. This did not deter me, however, from
contributing to the periodicals, which, from time to
time, accepted my efforts.”</p>

<p>“Did you remain long, as an editor, in Columbus?”</p>

<p>“No; only until 1861, when I was appointed consul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
at Venice. I really wanted to go to Germany, that I
might carry forward my studies in German literature;
and I first applied for the consulate at Munich. The
powers at Washington thought it quite the same thing
to offer me Rome, but I found that the income of the
Roman consulate would not give me a living, and I
was forced to decline it. Then the president’s private
secretaries, Mr. John Nicolay and Mr. John Hay, who
did not know me, except as a young westerner who
had written poems in the ‘Atlantic Monthly,’ asked me
how I would like Venice, promising that the salary
would be put up to $1,000 a year. It was really put up
to $1,500, and I accepted. I had four years of nearly
uninterrupted leisure at Venice.”</p>

<p>“Was it easier when you returned from Venice?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. On my return to America my literary
life took such form that most of my reading was done
for review. I wrote at first a good many of the lighter
criticisms in ‘The Nation,’ and then I went to Boston,
to become assistant editor of ‘The Atlantic Monthly,’
where I wrote the literary notices for that periodical
for four or five years.”</p>

<p>“You were eventually editor of the ‘Atlantic,’ were
you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, until 1881; and I have had some sort of close
relation with magazines ever since.”</p>

<p>“Would you say that all literary success is very difficult
to achieve?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“All that is enduring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“It seems to me ours is an age when fame comes
quickly.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of quickly made reputations,” said Mr.
Howells, meditatively, “did you ever hear of Alexander
Smith? He was a poet who, in the fifties, was proclaimed
immortal by the critics, and ranked with
Shakespeare. I myself read him with an ecstacy which,
when I look over his work to-day, seems ridiculous.
His poem, ‘Life-Drama,’ was heralded as an epic, and
set alongside of ‘Paradise Lost.’ I cannot tell how we
all came out of this craze, but the reading world is very
susceptible of such lunacies. He is not the only third-rate
poet who has been thus apotheosized, before and
since. You might have envied his great success, as I
certainly did; but it was not success, after all; and I am
sure that real success is always difficult to achieve.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe that success comes to those who
have a special bent or taste, which they cultivate by
hard work?”</p>

<p>“I can only answer that out of my literary experience.
For my own part, I believe I have never got any
good from a book that I did not read merely because I
wanted to read it. I think this may be applied to anything
a person does. The book, I know, which you read
from a sense of duty, or because for any reason you
must, is apt to yield you little. This, I think, is also
true of everything, and the endeavor that does one
good,—and lasting good,—is the endeavor one makes
with pleasure. Labor done in another spirit will serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
in a way, but pleasurable labor brings, on the whole, I
think, the greatest reward.”</p>


<h3>THE REWARDS OF LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>“You were probably strongly fascinated by the supposed
rewards of a literary career?”</p>

<p>“Yes. A definite literary ambition grew up in me,
and in the long reveries of the afternoon, when I was
distributing my case in the printing office, I fashioned a
future of overpowering magnificence and undying celebrity.
I should be ashamed to say what literary triumphs
I achieved in those preposterous deliriums. But
I realize now that such dreams are nerving, and sustain
one in an otherwise barren struggle.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever tempted and willing to abandon your
object of a literary life for something else?”</p>

<p>“I was once. My first and only essay, aside from literature,
was in the realm of law. It was arranged with
a United States senator that I should study law in his
office. I tried it a month, but almost from the first day,
I yearned to return to my books. I had not only to go
back to literature, but to the printing office, and I gladly
chose to do it,—a step I never regretted.”</p>

<p>“You started out to attain personal distinction and
happiness, did you not?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>


<h3>WHAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS.</h3>

<p>“You have attained the first,—but I should like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
know if your view of what constitutes happiness is the
same as when you began?”</p>

<p>“It is quite different. I have come to see life, not as
the chase of a forever-impossible personal happiness,
but as a field for endeavor toward the happiness of the
whole human family. There is no other success.</p>

<p>“I know, indeed, of nothing more subtly satisfying
and cheering than a knowledge of the real good will
and appreciation of others. Such happiness does not
come with money, nor does it flow from a fine physical
state. It cannot be bought. But it is the keenest joy,
after all, and the toiler’s truest and best reward.”</p>

<h2 class="num">XXVII<br />

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Famous Novelist Atones for Wasted
School Days by Self-Culture.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IN his study, a curiously-shaped building without
the accompaniment of a window, and combining
in equal proportions the Byzantine, Romanesque
and Doric styles of architecture, the gray-haired
author of “Ben Hur,” surrounded by his pictures,
books and military trophies, is spending, in serene and
comfortable retirement, the evening of his life. As I
sat beside him and listened to the recital of his earliest
struggles and later achievements, I could not help contrasting
his dignified bearing, careful expression, and
gentle demeanor, with another occasion in his life,
when, a vigorous, black-haired young military officer,
in the spring of 1861, he appeared, with flashing eye
and uplifted sword, at the head of his regiment, the
gallant and historic Eleventh Indiana Volunteers.</p>

<p>General Wallace never repels a visitor, and his greeting
is cordial and ingenuous.</p>

<p>“If I could say anything to stimulate or encourage
the young men of to-day,” he said, when I had explained
the object of my visit, “I would gladly do so,
but I fear that the story of my early days would be of
very little interest or value to others. So far as school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
education is concerned, it may be truthfully said that I
had but little, if any; and if, in spite of that deficiency,
I ever arrived at proficiency, I reached it, I presume, as
Topsy attained her stature,—‘just growed into it.’”</p>


<h3>HE WAS A CARELESS STUDENT.</h3>

<p>“Were you denied early school advantages?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Not in the least. On the contrary, I had most
abundant opportunity in that respect. My father was
a lawyer, enjoying a lucrative practice in Brookville,
Indiana,—a small town which bears the distinction of
having given to the world more prominent men than
any other place in the Hoosier state. Not long after
my birth, he was elected lieutenant-governor, and,
finally, governor of the state. He, himself, was an
educated man, having been graduated from the United
States Military Academy at West Point, and having
served as instructor in mathematics there. He was not
only an educated man, but a man of advanced ideas
generally, as shown by the fact that he failed of a re-election
to congress in 1840, because, as a member of
the committee on commerce, he gave the casting vote
in favor of an appropriation to develop Morse’s magnetic
telegraph. Of course, he believed in the value,
and tried to impress upon me the necessity of a
thorough school training; but, in the face of all the
solicitude and encouragement which an indulgent
father could waste on an unappreciative son, I remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
vexatiously indifferent. I presume I was like
some man in history,—it was Lincoln, I believe,—who
said that his father taught him to work, but he never
quite succeeded in teaching him to love it.</p>

<p>“My father sent me to school, and regularly paid
tuition,—for in those days there were no free schools;
but, much to my discredit, he failed to secure anything
like regular attendance at recitations, or even a decent
attempt to master my lessons at any time. In fact,
much of the time that should have been given to school
was spent in fishing, hunting and roaming through the
woods.”</p>


<h3>HE LOVED TO READ.</h3>

<p>“But were you thus indifferent to all forms of education?”</p>

<p>“No, my case was not quite so hopeless as that. I
did not desert the schools entirely, but my attendance
was so provokingly irregular and my indifference so
supreme, I wonder now that I was tolerated at all. But
I had one mainstay; I loved to read. I was a most
inordinate reader. In some lines of literature, especially
history and some kinds of fiction, my appetite
was insatiate, and many a day, while my companions
were clustered together in the old red brick schoolhouse,
struggling with their problems in fractions or
percentage, I was carefully hidden in the woods near
by, lying upon my elbows, munching an apple, and
reveling in the beauties of Plutarch, Byron or Goldsmith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you not attend college, or the higher grade of
schools?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for a brief period. My brother was a student
in Wabash College,—here in Crawfordsville,—and
hither I also was sent; but within six weeks I had tired
of the routine, was satiated with discipline, and made
my exit from the institution. I shall never forget what
my father did when I returned home. He called me
into his office, and, reaching into one of the pigeon-holes
above his desk, withdrew therefrom a package
of papers neatly folded and tied with the conventional
red tape. He was a very systematic man, due, perhaps,
to his West Point training, and these papers proved to
be the receipts for my tuition, which he had carefully
preserved. He called off the items, and asked me to
add them together. The total, I confess, staggered
me.”</p>


<h3>A FATHER’S FRUITFUL WARNING.</h3>

<p>“‘That sum, my son,’ he said, with a tone of regret
in his voice, ‘represents what I have expended in these
many years past to provide you with a good education.
How successful I have been, you know better than anyone
else. After mature reflection, I have come to the
conclusion that I have done for you in that direction
all that can reasonably be expected of any parent, and
I have, therefore, called you in to tell you that you have
now reached an age when you must take up the lines
yourself. If you have failed to profit by the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
with which I have tried so hard to surround you,
the responsibility must be yours. I shall not upbraid
you for your neglect, but rather pity you for the indifference
which you have shown to the golden opportunities
you have, through my indulgence, been enabled
to enjoy.’”</p>

<p>“What effect did this admonition have on you? Did
it awaken or arouse you?”</p>

<p>“It aroused me, most assuredly. It set me to thinking
as nothing before had done. The next day, I set
out with a determination to accomplish something for
myself. My father’s injunction rang in my ears. New
responsibilities rested on my shoulders, as I was, for
the first time in my life, my own master. I felt that
I must get work on my own account. After much
effort, I finally obtained employment from the man
with whom I had passed so many afternoons strolling
up and down the little streams in the neighborhood,
trying to fish. He was the county clerk, and he hired
me to copy what was known as the complete record
of one of the courts. I worked for months in a dingy,
half-lighted room, receiving for my pay something like
ten cents per hundred words. The tediousness and
regularity of the work was a splendid drill for me, and
taught me the virtue of persistence as one of the avenues
of success. It was at this time I began to realize
the deficiency in my education, especially as I had an
ambition to become a lawyer. Being deficient in both
mathematics and grammar, I was forced to study those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
branches evenings. Of course, the latter was a very
exacting study, after a full day’s hard work, but I was
made to realize that the time I had spent with such
lavish prodigality could not be recovered, and that I
must extract every possible good out of the golden
moments then flying by all too fast.”</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST LITERARY EFFORT.</h3>

<p>“Had you a distinct literary ambition at that time?”</p>

<p>“Well, I had always had a sort of literary bent or
inclination. I read all the literature of the day, besides
the standard authors, and finally began to devote
my odd moments to a book of my own,—a tale based
on the days of the crusades. When completed it covered
about three hundred and fifty pages, and bore the
rather high-sounding title, ‘The Man-at-Arms.’ I read
a good portion of it before a literary society to which
I belonged; the members applauded it, and I was frequently
urged to have it published. The Mexican War
soon followed, however, and I took the manuscript
with me when I enlisted; but before the close of my
service it was lost, and my production, therefore, never
reached the public eye.”</p>

<p>“But did not the approval which the book received
from the few persons who read it encourage you to
continue writing?”</p>

<p>“Fully fifty years have elapsed since then, and it is,
therefore, rather difficult, at this late day, to recall just
how such things affected me. I suppose I was encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
thereby, for, in due course of time, another
book which turned out to be ‘The Fair God,’—my first
book to reach the public,—began to shape itself in my
mind. The composition of this work was not, as the
theatrical people would say, a continuous performance,
for there were many and singular interruptions, and it
would be safe to say that months, and, in one case,
years, intervened between certain chapters. A few
years after the war, I finished the composition, strung
the chapters into a continuous narrative, leveled up the
uneven places, and started East with the manuscript.
A letter from Whitelaw Reid, then editor of the New
York ‘Tribune,’ introduced me to the head of one of
the leading publishing houses in Boston. There I was
kindly received, and, delivered my manuscript, which
was referred to a professional reader, to determine its
literary, and also, I presume, its commercial value.</p>

<p>“It would be neither a new nor an interesting story
to acquaint the public with the degree of anxious suspense
that pervaded my mind when I withdrew to
await the reader’s judgment. Every other writer has,
I assume, at one time or another, undergone much the
same experience. It was not long until I learned from
the publisher that the reader reported in favor of my
production. Publication soon followed, and for the
first time, in a literary sense, I found myself before the
public, and my book before the critics.”</p>

<p>“How long after this did ‘Ben Hur’ appear, and
what led you to write it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE ORIGIN OF “BEN HUR.”</h3>

<p>“I began ‘Ben Hur’ about 1876, and it was published
in 1880. The purpose, at first, was a short serial for
one of the magazines, descriptive of the visit of the
wise men to Jerusalem as mentioned in the first two
verses of the second chapter of Matthew. It will be
recognized in ‘Book First’ of the work as now published.
For certain reasons, however, the serial idea
was abandoned, and the narrative, instead of ending
with the birth of the Savior, expanded into a more pretentious
novel and only ended with the death scene on
Calvary. The last ten chapters were written in the
old adobe palace at Sante Fe, New Mexico, where I
was serving as governor. It is difficult to answer the
question, ‘what led me to write the book?’ or why I
chose a piece of fiction which used Christ as its leading
character. In explanation, it is proper to state that I
had reached an age in life when men usually begin to
study themselves with reference to their fellowmen, and
reflect on the good they may have done in the world.
Up to that time, never having read the Bible, I knew
nothing about sacred history; and in matters of a religious
nature, although I was not in every respect an
infidel, I was persistently and notoriously indifferent.
I did not know, and, therefore, did not care. I resolved
to begin the study of the good book in earnest.</p>


<h3>CONVERTED WHILE WRITING HIS OWN BOOK.</h3>

<p>“I was in quest of knowledge, but I had no faith to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
sustain, no creed to bolster up. The result was that the
whole field of religious and biblical history opened up
before me, and, my vision not being clouded by previously
formed opinions, I was enabled to survey it
without the aid of lenses. I believe I was thorough
and persistent. I know I was conscientious in my
search for the truth. I weighed, I analyzed, I counted
and compared. The evolution from conjecture into
knowledge, through opinion and belief, was gradual
but irresistible; and at length I stood firmly and defiantly
on the solid rock. Upward of seven hundred
thousand copies of ‘Ben Hur’ have been published, and
it has been translated into all languages from French to
Arabic; but, whether it has ever influenced the mind of
a single reader or not, I am sure its conception and preparation,
if it has done nothing more, has convinced its
author of the divinity of the lowly Nazarene who
walked and talked with God.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Social Leader, Having “Eyes That
See,” Earns Literary Laurels.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>MRS. BURTON HARRISON, the gifted American
authoress, is a charming woman socially.
She is unaffected in manner, and easy
and graceful in conversation. When I called,
I was ushered into her library and study, and was entertained
in the same delightful way in which her books
are written. Indeed, she told me that she writes without
effort, and endeavors to do so naturally.</p>

<p>It was a pretty story she told me of her childhood
days in Old Virginia, where she spent the greater part
of her time in reading standard works, and in dreaming
of an almost unformed ambition. “Even in my
youngest years,” she said, “I used to make up fairy
tales. Later, I put my thoughts on paper.”</p>

<p>“And what was your first experience in a literary
way?” I asked.</p>

<p>“When I was about seventeen years old, I sent a
love story to the ‘Atlantic Monthly.’ It was lurid and
melancholy,” she said, with a smile. “It was returned
in due course of time, and across its face was written,
in very bright ink, ‘This is far better than the average,
and ought to be read through,’ from which I inferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
that only the first page had been read. But I was encouraged
even by that.”</p>


<h3>HER FIRST NOVEL.</h3>

<p>“My next attempt was a novel, which I called ‘Skirmishing.’
It was destroyed in a fire, for which I have
ever since felt grateful.”</p>

<p>Miss Constance Cary (her maiden name), next went
abroad with her widowed mother, and spent some years
in traveling and in completing her education.</p>

<p>“It was not until after I returned to America,” she
said, “and was married to Mr. Harrison, that I was
again bold enough to take up my pen. I wrote a little
article, which I called ‘A Little Centennial Lady.’ It
was published in ‘Scribner’s Magazine,’ and had so
favorable a reception that I was encouraged to write
‘Golden Rod,’ a story of Mount Desert, which appeared
later in ‘Harper’s Magazine.’”</p>


<h3>BOOKS SHE ENJOYED.</h3>

<p>“My books that I have enjoyed most, if a writer may
enjoy her own work, have not been those dealing with
New York social life, but my tales of the south.
Charles A. Dana, of the New York ‘Sun,’ was unconsciously
responsible for my ‘Old Dominion.’ He gave
me the agreeable task of editing the ‘Monticello Letters,’
and from them I gleaned a story which outlined
my ‘Old Dominion.’ But the editors cry for stories of
New York social life, to gratify the popular demand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison’s books are so well known that it is
unnecessary to dwell on their acknowledged merit,
vividness, and truthfulness to life. To the general
public, there is something fascinating about a New
York social story, dealing with the millionaire’s club
life, woman’s teas, and love’s broken lances. Besides
the general desire for a good social novel, there is a
morbid, unsatiated desire to pry into the doings, customs
and manners of the rich. It is with agreeable
expectations that one picks up one of Mrs. Harrison’s
books; it is almost with the knowledge that you will
be entertained.</p>


<h3>HER CHARACTERS ARE FROM LIFE.</h3>

<p>On a former call, she told me that her New York
stories are built on her observations, and that the characters
are so changed as not to antagonize her friends,
for she enters the best society through her family ties
and her well-earned prestige.</p>

<p>“It is very peculiar,” she continued, “how, in writing
a story, the characters govern me, not I the characters.
I may have the outline and ending of a book in my
mind, but the characters take everything into their
hands, and walk independently through the pages. I
have always found it best to obey. The ending of
‘Anglomaniacs,’ which caused so much adverse criticism,
was not as I had planned. I was helpless under
the caprices of the characters. At first, I was displeased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
at the ending; but now, looking back upon it,
I am well satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Then the characters to you become real, and you
are entirely under their spell, merely chronicling what
to you appears real?”</p>


<h3>IN LOVE WITH HER WORK.</h3>

<p>“Yes, if I did not believe in them, I would be unable
to write; for the time being, I am living and observing
a dozen lives. There is much satisfaction in doing so
correctly. I am in love with my work, and am a hard
worker.”</p>

<p>For the past few months, Mrs. Harrison has been
idle, by the advice of her physicians, and has spent
the season abroad, traveling over the continent.</p>

<p>“But all the time, I am turning little romances over
in my mind, and when I can no longer keep my pen
from paper, I suppose I shall sit down and write,” she
said. “Last winter, I was under a pretty heavy strain,
and my overworked condition compelled me to rest for
a while.”</p>

<p>Many amusing little instances touching upon her
work have come to her attention.</p>

<p>“One morning,” said Mrs. Harrison, “after my husband
had successfully defended a client, the man
grasped his hand very warmly, and, to my husband’s
amazement, said, ‘Well, Mr. Harrison, I want to tell
you what we think of your wife. She’s the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
writer in the English language, that’s what my daughter
says. She says there are no books like hers.’</p>

<p>“‘Which one does she like most?’ asked my husband,
immensely pleased.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ he replied, ‘I can’t just answer that, but I
think it’s “Your Eyre.”’</p>

<p>“Once I received a rather startling letter from a
western ranchman. It said, ‘Your book has been going
the rounds, but it always comes back, and I have
threatened to put a bullet in the hide of the man who
does not return it.’ I was greatly pleased with that
letter.</p>

<p>“The most gratifying letter I ever received was from
a man in a prison. He begged to be supplied with all I
had written.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was a man who had been in society, and
there is a little story connected with his imprisonment.”</p>


<h3>SHE IS A GENTLE, FORCEFUL WOMAN.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Harrison has made many close friends through
her books. Once she was with a party of friends in a
Madrid gallery. Her name was mentioned, and a
Spanish lady came forward, and introduced herself, at
the same time expressing her admiration for her.</p>

<p>“She is now one of my dearest friends,” concluded
Mrs. Harrison.</p>

<p>Just then, a colored man appeared in her library,
bearing a tray,—for afternoon tea,—so I arose, although
she asked me to have a cup of tea, fearing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
I might be intruding, and expressed my wish that she
would soon be at her desk again.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall,” she said, “for it is irksome being
idle.”</p>

<p>Such is Mrs. Harrison’s disposition. Indeed, it is
hard to imagine her idle. Orders are pouring in upon
her, which through her present weak health, she is
forced to decline.</p>

<p>But what is my impression about her? She is a
gentle, forceful woman, whose energy and painstaking
have placed her in the front rank of American writers.
Without the latter attributes, her talent would have
fallen to the ground.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Painstaking, the Secret of a Celebrated
Painter’s Success.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>UNDOUBTEDLY the best-known American artist
is Edwin Austin Abbey. He has done
more than any other man to spread the fame
of American art in Europe. He has proceeded,
step by step, from his early youth, when he
earned fifteen dollars a week as a “hack-artist,” until
he ranks as the greatest living decorative painter. The
history of his life is an inspiration to students, as it
furnishes striking evidence of what hard work and self-confidence
can accomplish in the field of art. Mr. Abbey
advanced gradually from water-colors and pen-sketching
to oil-painting, pastel and fine decorative work.
Although he is a very prolific artist, he has maintained
a surprising degree of excellence. His work breathes
forth his personality, and shows the character of the
man; there is confidence in every line. His taste is as
fine, as his art and execution are perfect, and he has an
extraordinary degree of comprehension and receptivity,
due to his American blood.</p>

<p>Mr. Abbey has scholarly ability and intense application,
but they would have availed him little if they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
not seconded a talent of the most unusual order, and
an individuality which is so personal that it may be said
of him that he resembles no other living painter. It is
only natural that he should have gained success in his
chosen line of work, for his heart has been in it from
his boyhood days. His earnest efforts have always
been appreciated both in Europe and America. Only
two seasons after he went to live in England, he was
elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in
Water Colors. In 1889, he received a first-class medal
at the Paris Exposition, and, in 1896, he was honored
by an associate membership in the Royal Academy.
Two years later he was received into full membership,
though John R. Sargent, his fellow-countryman, had to
wait three years. Mr. Abbey was honored by King Edward
VII with a commission to paint the coronation
scene in Westminster Abbey, and by the Pennsylvania
legislature with a commission to decorate the new
state capitol at Harrisburg.</p>


<h3>A MOST INTERESTING STUDIO.</h3>

<p>During a recent trip to England, I determined to
visit Mr. Abbey, and obtain from him some message
for his young countrymen who are beginning where he
began thirty years ago. He has a beautiful country
house known as Morgan Hall, in Gloucestershire, an
attractive English county. In this house is the largest
private studio in the whole country, built especially for
the preparation of the Boston Library decorations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
which Mr. Abbey recently completed. It measures
twenty-five by fourteen yards, and has a high ceiling.
In this room I observed a number of great easels, for
Mr. Abbey usually has several pictures in progress at
one time, but they occupied only a fraction of the space.
It would be hard to imagine a studio more perfectly
equipped for work. Great tapestries hung from heavy
frames, not for ornamentation, but for study; carved
oak doors and panels were resting against the walls,
and scattered everywhere were casts of curious architecture.
Priceless armor was displayed on every side,
and along the walls were a number of canvases which
had been used for studies, or paintings which had not
been completed. There were chests filled with velvets,
brocades and silks of various ancient periods. All these
things are accessories of Mr. Abbey’s craft and nothing
more. He uses them in working out the details of his
historical paintings. There were trestles full of elaborate
studies and half-finished drawings standing about,
and, tacked upon the walls were photographs of pictures
of many interesting periods.</p>

<p>Mr. Abbey has also a vast collection of costumes.
They are of all periods, and one might suppose himself
in the stock room of some great theater. All these costumes
help in depicting the dress worn at some great
event which the artist desires to put upon canvas. Mr.
Abbey is very accurate and careful in his work, and has
never been challenged in any details of fact, of costume,
of architecture, or of accessory. It must not be supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
that any of these costumes and decorations are
copied in the paintings; they are merely suggestions for
invention.</p>

<p>Mr. Abbey’s industry and energy are prodigious, so
that I was quite prepared to find him at work when I
visited his studio. Although the artist has lived abroad
for many years, he is thoroughly American in his personality,
and I might have been talking with him at a
Philadelphia studio, instead of in the heart of England.</p>


<h3>HE WAS NOT A PRECOCIOUS BOY.</h3>

<p>“There was nothing at all extraordinary about my
boyhood,” he said, in answer to a question. “I was
very much like other boys, perhaps less promising than
most. I remember that my parents complained because
I was unable to fix my ambition upon any single
profession, and they urged that I must have some definite
aim in life. When I appeared unable to decide for
myself, they undertook to decide for me and to formulate
plans for my future. They suggested that I enter
the ministry, but I had an instinct which told me that
I was fitted for no such career. I told them then that
art offered a greater attraction, and they were willing
that I should begin studying. I entered the Academy
of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and was delighted with
my undertaking from the very beginning.</p>

<p>“Of course I was interested in all that pertained to
art, and especially in drawing in black and white. I
read all publications which printed work of this sort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and especially ‘Punch’ and ‘The Graphic,’ so that they
had no inconsiderable share in my instruction in the
use of a pencil. I used to observe the styles of the different
artists and study the best in each.</p>

<p>“In 1871, my father suggested that it was time to
decide whether or not I was to earn my livelihood as
an artist, and I decided that it should be my life-work.
I was fortunate in obtaining employment in the art
department of Harper and Brothers, in New York City.
I was only nineteen years old at the time, and was filled
with enthusiasm over my work. I was anxious to learn
as much as possible, and Harper’s was an excellent
place for me. I was given a great variety of work, and
received every encouragement for earnest effort. Every
improvement in my drawings was appreciated. Several
boys who worked with me at that time have since become
famous in the art world, notably Reinhart and
Alexander. Even the boys who swept out the office
were gaining an excellent start, for one of them has
since become one of the most famous Franco-American
painters, practicing in Paris.”</p>


<h3>HIS WORK WAS ENCOURAGED.</h3>

<p>“My first published drawing represented the demolition
of the Vendome Column in Paris by the French
Commune, and I shall never forget my pleasure at seeing
it in ‘Harper’s Weekly.’ It doesn’t matter how old
we get, we’re sure to remember our first appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
I received many congratulations for my effort and continued
my work with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“The young artists in Harper’s offices were given
all sorts of subjects to do, pictorial, illustrative and
reportorial, and this variety has been of the utmost
value to me. There was one sort of work, however,
that I preferred above all others. When only a lad I
fell in love with the classic literature of England; Goldsmith
was always one of my favorite authors, and
whenever I had spare time I devoted it to illustrating
some of the stories that I had read. I was especially
fond of English history, so you can imagine my delight
when it was decided that I was to illustrate the
works of Herrick for ‘Harper’s Monthly,’ with a view
to ultimate publication in book form.</p>

<p>“It was then that I first came to England. I thought
it advisable to live for a time in the English country,
and I settled for two years in one of the most picturesque
districts of Worcestershire. I need not tell you
that I enjoyed that visit, and, when I returned to America,
in 1880, it was only to remain eight months and to
arrange my affairs so that I could return here. Although
I had lost none of my regard for the land of my
birth, I felt that, if I was to draw pictures from English
history, England was the place for me to live in, so
here I have been ever since, save for occasional journeys
to America and the Continent.”</p>

<p>Mr. Abbey breathed a sigh of relief as he finished the
narrative of his early days. “But this doesn’t bring you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
up to date,” I said, “and the most interesting story is
about what you’ve done since.” But the artist shook
his head. “It’s simply a record of steady work,” he
said; “you already know about the chief paintings I
have done in late years.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” I said, “you are doing nothing now but
painting in oils?”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” replied Mr. Abbey, “and my contracts
will prevent me from doing any other kind of work in
the near future. I didn’t begin painting in oils until I
had been working many years; the ‘Mayday Morn,’
my first exhibit, was not shown until 1890. It seems
quite the usual thing for artists to take up oils after
they are known chiefly by black and white or water
colors.”</p>


<h3>HE ALWAYS TAKES PAINS.</h3>

<p>“It is well known that you spend much time in preparing
the subjects of your paintings,” I said, “but
there aren’t many artists who worry about the technical
details as you do.”</p>

<p>“I won’t say that I worry about them,” replied Mr.
Abbey. “An artist should study for his profession just
as a man should prepare for the law or medicine, and
should never consider that natural ability is all that he
requires for success. He should have a knowledge of
architecture and sculpture as well as of the principles
of drawing; in short, he should carefully learn what
may be called ‘the grammar of his profession.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I am to paint a subject which is mythological,
I am at pains to absorb the atmosphere of the
period, and to learn something of the geography in
which the legendary figures moved. I visit the scene
of the story, obtain every picture which will give me a
knowledge of the dress of the period, and I am not
satisfied until I have exhausted every possible source
of information. It is well known that Sir Frederick
Leighton constantly refreshed his mind and memory
by visiting the classic scenes of his paintings.</p>

<p>“Some artists have been known to go so far as to
paint a scene as an artist living in the period of the
story would have painted it. I regard this as rather
extreme. It is well to have the details perfect, but
modern art has some advantage of technique and color
which are not to be despised. I would not have you
believe that technical efficiency is the greatest essential
in an artist’s qualifications, only it is a valuable asset
when added to natural ability and earnestness of purpose.”</p>


<h3>PERSISTENCE AND HARD WORK COUNT.</h3>

<p>Mr. Abbey has invariably practiced what he advises
other artists to do. Before beginning the decorative
paintings for the delivery room of the Boston Library,
he spent many months traveling in Italy, collecting
information which might aid him in the paintings of
the Holy Grail. But in the end he decided that the
scene should not be in Italy at all, and his effort went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
for nothing, as far as that particular series was concerned.
He spent four years of unsurpassable toil,
study and application in completing the first five of the
pictures, and when they were done the public was not
slow to appreciate the effort he had evidently put forth.
Mr. Abbey could not have chosen a subject more worthy
of his talent. He has confidence in his ideas of
what is best in art, is full of mediæval feeling, and is
endowed,—in spite of his sunny, hopeful temperament,—with
an appreciation of the tragedy underlying so
much of human life. In historical pictures, he considers
no toil too great to make sure of accuracy, and
his university training has been of the greatest assistance
to him in his work.</p>

<p>“No artist can be too well educated,” he said, during
my conversation with him; “every bit of information is
sure to be of use to him sooner or later, in one painting
or another.</p>

<p>“I am glad,” he said, “if I can encourage anyone to
hard work, for surely that is the chief aid to success in
any career. The young person who believes that an
artist’s life is a bed of roses, and that he needs only to
ply the brush a few hours each day, is mistaken. He
must be scholarly by nature, must have a wide and
minute acquaintance with art, and must never consider
that he has learned it all if he hopes for lasting fame. I
might add that he must also have earnest convictions
regarding his work, and the courage to carry them out.
Given these qualifications, combined with talent, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
course, any person should succeed as well in the field
of art as in any other profession, providing he is willing
to give a reasonable time to study and preparation.
Although the world may call him master, the true artist
will never regard himself as other than a student.”</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A School Girl, Not Afraid of Drudgery,
Becomes America’s Foremost
Woman Illustrator.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>IN the heart of Philadelphia’s great business quarter,
on lower Chestnut street, there stands a five-story,
red brick building which is about as reserved
looking as Philadelphia business structures
can be, and before which, in the street below, the
tide of traffic rumbles and clatters and clangs from
early morning until night. It doesn’t look much like a
place where a person could be free enough from noise
and other distractions to exercise a fine artistic taste.</p>

<p>Yet it was here, I was informed, that Alice Barber
Stephens had her studio, and to this I was bound.
Mrs. Stephens takes rank with A. B. Frost, Howard
Pyle, A. B. Wenzell, C. D. Gibson and others, and
there are those who put her before several of these.
I remember looking over a book of her drawings,
published by some New York house, entitled “The
American Woman in the Home,” and admiring exceedingly
the gentle, refined appearance of the mothers,
the excellent sedateness and sympathetic beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
young married daughters, and the quiet modesty of the
girls in these pictures.</p>

<p>You would say, looking at these drawings, “Here is
a plain, commonplace, genuine person, who illustrates.”
She has swept, sewed, performed the duty that lay
nearest. You can see it in the sketches. She paints
because she likes to, and as well as she can. She has
no thought of immortality, nor imagines that she will
be hailed as a marvel, but simply believes it is well and
interesting to do good work.</p>

<p>Considering these things, I made my way one afternoon
up several flights of stairs,—artists must have the
sky-light, you know,—to a door labeled A. B. Stephens,
which was opened by a tall, slender, reserved-looking
woman, who smiled as she admitted that she was Alice
Barber Stephens. After a sentence or two of explanation,
an invitation was extended to enter.</p>


<h3>ART IGNORES NOISE.</h3>

<p>It was as if one had dropped a stage curtain upon the
rattling, excited scene without. Comfortable chairs
were scattered about. Screens and tall bric-a-brac
cases of oriental workmanship divided spaces and filled
corners. A great square of sunshine fell from a sky-light,
and in one corner a Dutch clock slowly ticked.
The color of the walls was a dull brick red, and against
them stood light brown shelves, holding white and blue
china vases, jugs and old plates. Sketches in ink, wash
and color were here and there on the wall, and in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
place a large canvas showing Market street, Philadelphia,
near City Hall, on a rainy day, gave a sombre yet
rather pleasing touch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stephens had returned to her easel, on which
was a large sketch in black and white, showing a young
rake, with his body bent forward, his elbows resting on
his knees, his face buried in his hands,—the picture of
despair. Some picture for a novel it was, the title of
which might easily have been “The Fool and His
Money.”</p>

<p>“You won’t mind my working,” said Mrs. Stephens,
and I hastened to explain that I wouldn’t, and didn’t.</p>

<p>She put touches here and there on the picture, as we
talked of women in art, and the conversation did not
seem to distract her attention from the work in hand,
which advanced rapidly.</p>


<h3>GIRLS’ CHANCES AS ILLUSTRATORS.</h3>

<p>“Don’t you believe it is easier, to-day, for a young
girl to succeed in illustrating than it is for a young
man?”</p>

<p>“Well, possibly,” she answered. “Neither girl nor
boy can succeed without aptitude and the hardest kind
of work, but girls are rather novel in the field, and
their work may receive slightly more gentle consideration
to begin with. It would not be accepted, however,
without merit.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t the smaller remuneration which women accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
something to do with the popularity of the woman
illustrator?”</p>

<p>“Very little, if any,” she answered. “I find that
women are about as quick, perhaps more so, than men,
to demand good prices for clever work, although they
have less of the egotism of men artists.”</p>

<p>“You judge from your own case,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Not at all. I never possessed cleverness. It was
need and determination with me, and I can honestly
say that all I have gained has been by the most earnest
application. I never could do anything with a dash.
It was always slow, painstaking effort; and it is yet.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever exhibit?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Stephens, “not any more. There
was a time when I had an ambition to shine as a
painter, and as long as I had that ambition I neither
shone as a painter nor made more than a living as an
illustrator. I made up my mind, however, that I was
not to be a great woman painter, and I decided to apply
myself closely to the stronger, illustrative tendency
which fascinated me. From that time on my success
dates, and I am rather proud now that I was able to
recognize my limitations.”</p>

<p>“Did you find that in marrying you made your work
more difficult to pursue?” I ventured, for her interesting
home life is a notable feature of her career.</p>

<p>“I cannot say that I did. There is more to do, but
there is also a greater desire to do it. I love my boy,
and I take time to make his home life interesting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
satisfying. When he was ill, I removed my easel from
the studio to a room adjoining the sick-chamber at the
house, and worked there.”</p>


<h3>HOW SHE BEGAN.</h3>

<p>Her instinct for art seems to have been a gift direct.
As a very little girl her facility with the pencil delighted
her teachers, and after the regular exercises of
the day she was allowed to occupy her time drawing
whatever fancy or surroundings might suggest. At
seven years of age her parents removed to Philadelphia,
and there the young artist encountered school
regulations which rather debarred her from following
her beloved pastime. But her talent was so pronounced
that one day in every week was allowed her in which
to attend the School of Design—an arrangement that
continued until she entered the grammar school.</p>

<p>A few years later she became a regular student at
this School of Design, where she took a course of wood
engraving, but did not relax her study of drawing. As
an engraver she became so successful that her work
soon became remunerative, and gave her means to
enter the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. At the
same time her progress as an engraver was so marked
that her efforts were brought to the attention of the art
editor of “Scribner’s Magazine,” for whom, to illustrate
an article on the academy, she engraved the
“Woman’s Life Class,” from her own drawing. Soon
her drawings gave her a reputation, and she abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
engraving. Her first published drawings were for
school-book illustrations, from which her field widened
and her work came into great demand.</p>

<p>In 1887 she was married and spent ten months
abroad, studying for a part of the time in Paris in the
school of Julien and of Carlo Rossi, devoting the remainder
of her stay in travel. Upon her return she
was prevailed upon to become an instructor in the
Philadelphia School of Design, where she introduced
life-class study, which has met with marked success.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>A Schoolboy’s Sketches Reveal the
Bent of a Talented Illustrator.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>FREDERIC REMINGTON’S drawings and
paintings of ranch life are so full of action and
so vigorously drawn that they have attracted
attention all over the United States and abroad,
wherever true art is honored. No living artist can
equal Remington in bringing into life, as it were, on
the very canvas, a bucking broncho, or the sweeping
charge of a force of Uncle Sam’s cavalry. One fairly
sees the dust on the scorching alkali plains, and hears
the quick clatter of the horse’s hoofs as he strikes the
ground, and gathers his legs again.</p>

<p>And yet, with all his success, Mr. Remington is most
unassuming. I went to New Rochelle, where he has a
cosy place on the crest of a hill. He was in his studio,
which is an addition to the house; and, as I descended
a few steps, he rose from before his easel to greet me.
His working coat was covered with paint, and he held
a brush in his left hand. He had not been warned of
my mission, and seemed almost startled.</p>

<p>“I cannot shake hands,” he said, looking at me,
“mine are soiled; I am a painter, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat down, hanging one arm over the back of his
chair.</p>

<p>“Don’t write about me, but speak of my art!” said
Mr. Remington.</p>

<p>“But you and your art are one,” I replied, looking
around the studio, and to its walls hung with Indian
relics. “Most of your pictures are from experiences
of your own in the great far west, are they not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not all,” was the reminiscent reply.</p>

<p>“And those trophies?” I added, glancing at them.</p>

<p>“O, I bought most of them. That jacket I bought
from a mounted policeman. Pretty, isn’t it? I am
able to depict the western country and life, because I
have been there.”</p>


<h3>REMINGTON’S SCHOOLBOY EFFECTS.</h3>

<p>“When did you first take up art?”</p>

<p>“I studied some art at the Yale Art School, and a
little at the Art League. When I was a schoolboy, I
was forever making sketches on the margin of my
school-books, but I never really studied it much,
although my dream was to be an artist. At nineteen, I
caught the fever to go west, and incidentally to become
rich. That was my idea; art came second. I ranched
it, and got into Indian campaigns. I have always been
fond of horses and out-of-door life, and I got plenty of
it there, with every opportunity to study the rough life,
the lay of the country, and the peculiar atmosphere.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Remington,” I asked, “how do you get that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
‘devil-may-care’ look in the faces of your cowboys and
soldiers?”</p>

<p>His face lighted up, and a deep twinkle came into
his eyes. He glanced across the room at just such a
picture as I had described. He took his pipe out of his
mouth and laid it on the window sill.</p>


<h3>REMINGTON’S ATTENTION TO DETAIL.</h3>

<p>“Kipling says that, ‘a single man in a barrack is not
a plaster saint,’ and that is about it. That cavalryman
posed for me on his horse. But not all of my work is
from life. I go west for three months every year, and
gather a lot of sketches and then work them up. Those
color sketches there,—a chief and his daughter,—are
from life. You see I was able to get all the color.
Yet I like to depict white men best; they are more
interesting.”</p>

<p>My eyes rested on an unfinished picture, toward
which, every now and then, Mr. Remington turned a
thoughtful gaze as if trying to think of something. It
was a birch-bark canoe, with a figure at either end;
the water was smooth, and the shore was wooded. One
person in the motionless canoe was fishing.</p>

<p>“Is that from memory?” I asked of the artist.</p>

<p>“Partly,” he said, with a smile. “I used to see a
good many photographs of trout fishing in the Adirondacks;
lines taut, and then hurling a trout through the
air, to land it in the canoe. So once I thought I would
try it myself. I went up there and fished for two weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
in the rain. I am trying to think how to make the rain
appear to strike and bounce from the water. You know
how water looks when it is raining,”—and there came
into his face a thoughtful and studious look, showing
how carefully he weighed every detail of his work.</p>

<p>Mr. Remington rises early, has breakfast at seven,
and works until three, when he takes his customary
horseback ride across the country.</p>

<p>“Do you work from inspiration?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I do not know what you mean, exactly. I must
have a study in my mind, and then I work it out.
Some mornings I can do but little; but I am kept exceedingly
busy with constant orders to fill, besides
illustrating my own articles.”</p>


<h3>HOW HIS WAR PICTURES ARE MADE.</h3>

<p>“That painting of the charge of the Rough Riders
up San Juan hill, and your other Cuban pictures, must
have been interesting work.”</p>

<p>“I saw Roosevelt just before but not during the
charge. But when you see one, you see all. The
fighting to-day is done in long, thin lines; the solid
formations are no longer used. It makes too great a
target. You are never out of range, for the bullets
carry a mile and a half. Most of the fighting is done
lying down, the front line advancing, and the others
harassing the enemy. To me there was nothing enjoyable
about it. A correspondent is worse off than
the soldier. He has no means of transportation. Fortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
in Cuba, I secured a horse the day before the
battle. I made a great number of sketches, but lost
one of my sketch books while crawling on my hands
and knees through the long grass. It contained many
bits of action, which I wanted. I suppose it was spoiled,
or maybe someone found it. But in my younger days,
I actually enjoyed being in the midst of an Indian
fight. The climate is so different, and entirely to my
liking, out west.”</p>

<p>We rose and viewed the studio.</p>

<p>“How do you get that peculiar alkali, yellowish air
of the plains?” I asked, as we stood before an example
of Mr. Remington’s art.</p>

<p>“Only by having lived there, and after a dint of
study. That is a dust study.”</p>

<p>“And those blue shadows are correct?”</p>


<h3>COLOR OF THE PLAINS.</h3>

<p>“Yes; you cannot have a black shade out in the
open, and the atmosphere there causes that particular
shade. That one above, though, which is also a study,
shows an almost steel gray shadow, while that other
one is still darker. These are ‘color notes,’ of Indian
ponies, and bronchos. There is no crest or arch to
their necks. They are really degenerated horses, but
they can go.”</p>

<p>On a pedestal was a casting of the “Broncho Buster.”</p>

<p>“You must have modeled in clay before you did
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, that was my first attempt. I had never put
my hands to clay before. Painting and modeling are
about the same. You must know anatomy in both. I
never intended to have it cast, but some of my friends,
on seeing it, said I should, so I had it done. ‘Bunkie,’
which means, in the army, ‘comrade,’ is my second
work.”</p>

<p>It was only in 1885 that Mr. Remington turned his
whole attention to art. On leaving Yale, where he was
more devoted to football than to study, he served for
a brief period as confidential clerk to Governor Cornell,
at Albany. But that life was too prosaic; and, in
1880, he caught the fever, “to go west.” He went to
Montana, and became a “cow-puncher.” Later, he
made money on a Kansas mule ranch, and was cowboy,
guide and scout in the southwest. When he had run
through what he had earned, he returned to Kansas
City, where the shops displayed his first work. They
possessed the now well-known Remington style, but
the colors were daubed on so that they looked like
chromos, although the drawings had that muscular
dash and action for which his work is noted.</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST SKETCH.</h3>

<p>“My first drawing,” said Mr. Remington, “appeared
in Harper’s. It was redrawn by them, but it had in it
that which they liked.”</p>

<p>In the meantime he had married, and he started east
with his wife. They arrived in New York with just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
three dollars. After engaging a small room, he made a
bee-line for Harper’s with a number of sketches. They
were accepted on the spot, and since then there has
been no more successful illustrator than Frederic Remington
among the celebrated artists of America.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Rebuffs and Disappointments Fail to
Repress a Great Cartoonist’s
Genius.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>TO-DAY Homer C. Davenport is the “first
cartoonist” of America, and yet he is but
thirty-five years old. Mr. Davenport has a
small place in Roseville, on the outskirts of
Newark, New Jersey. He is a tall, handsome man,
with large, humorous eyes, beneath heavy eyelids, that
give him an expression of perpetual thought.</p>

<p>“I suppose you want to see my studio?” Mr. Davenport
said. We went upstairs.</p>

<p>“This is it,” he said, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>It was merely a small, square room, with a few
framed pictures on the papered walls, and a desk in
the corner. There was no easel in the room, but I
saw a drawing-board under the desk.</p>


<h3>DAVENPORT’S UNIQUE STUDIO.</h3>

<p>“You work on that board, when on the desk?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are disappointed,” said his sister, with a smile.
“It is not what you expected.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>It wasn’t. I had expected to see a typical studio,
with unfinished cartoons, and the usual artistic surroundings.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport laid an unfinished cartoon on the
desk, representing a chariot race, and laughed when
he explained what it would be and mean; and this told
me that he enters heartily in whatever he draws, which
is requisite to success in art as well as in other things.
Then we adjourned to another room and sat about a
wood fire.</p>

<p>“Tell me of your beginning,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, I was born in Oregon, thirty-five years ago,
on my father’s farm. As a child, I was perpetually
drawing, and to my father I owe much, for it was he
who encouraged me, my mother dying when I was
very young. I would lie flat on my stomach, and draw
on the floor, if I had no paper. As I spent hours this
way, the habit became injurious to my digestive organs,
so a flat cushion was made for me. I was a hopelessly
poor student, doing more drawing on my slate
and on the margins of my books than studying. To
sit in school for any length of time made me sick and
nervous, so my father called on the schoolmaster and
gave instructions that, whenever I got tired, I should
be allowed to draw, or to go home.”</p>


<h3>HE DREW CARTOONS IN SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>“This was rather demoralizing to the school, for
even then I drew cartoons. Finally, I was taken away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and my father painted a blackboard, four feet high by
fifteen feet long, on the side of a room in the farm-house,
where, with plenty of chalk, I drew to my
heart’s content. I would draw all day.”</p>

<p>“And you received no instructions in drawing?”</p>

<p>“I never had a lesson in my life. It was my father’s
ambition for me to become a cartoonist. When, in
later years, I did anything that he considered particularly
good, he would carry me off to Portland, and I
would submit it to the Portland ‘Oregonian,’ where my
attempts were always laughed at. Then, much crestfallen,
I would return to the farm.</p>

<p>“‘Now, my boy,’ my father would say, ‘that is good
enough to be printed,’ and off I would go again.</p>

<p>“At length, the news spread that I had a job on the
Portland ‘Oregonian.’ The whole town became interested,
and when the day arrived for my departure, the
band of which I was a member, and many of the townspeople,
escorted me with due honor to the railroad
station.”</p>


<h3>HIS FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT.</h3>

<p>“‘Well,’ I heard some say, ‘I guess we will never see
him again. He’s too big for this place.’</p>

<p>“I was on the Portland ‘Oregonian’ just one day.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the sense of this?’ I was asked. ‘You
can’t draw,’ and back I went.</p>

<p>“I had before me the mortification of meeting the
righteous disgust of my friends. On my way back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Silverton, I heard that they were short of a brakeman
at the Portland end, so I beat my way back to Portland,
and, walking into the office, offered myself.</p>

<p>“‘What!’ said the man. ‘What do you know about
braking? I would like to know who sent you on such
a fool’s errand?’ and he raved and stamped, and swore
he would discharge everyone on the train. But on
the next train, I went out as head brakeman. All the
elements got together,—it rained and snowed and
froze, and when I got to Silverton, almost frozen, I
slipped from the train and tramped home, a much disheartened
young man.</p>

<p>“But just to show my father I had something in me,
and wanted to make my way in life, I asked to be sent
to an institution of learning, where I stayed just one
week. Then I got a place attending to the ink roller
in the local printing office, where the town paper was
published, which, to this day, I do not think can be
beaten,”—and Mr. Davenport laughed in his hearty
way.</p>


<h3>AT TEN DOLLARS A WEEK.</h3>

<p>“Finally, my star rose on the horizon. I went to San
Francisco, and was taken on trial on the ‘Examiner.’
I remember the day well,—February 2, 1892. For one
mortal week, I simply hung around the office. Then
I was put to work at ten dollars a week. But I proved
unsatisfactory. I drew the man over me aside.</p>

<p>“‘Look here,’ I said, ‘I can’t draw. I want you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
write to my father and tell him what a failure I am,
and that his belief that I am an artist is the delusive
mistake of a fond parent.’ He sat down to write, and,
as he was doing so, my fingers, always itching to draw,
were at work with a pencil in sketching horses, on a
piece of paper on the table.</p>

<p>“‘When did you do that?’ he asked, picking up the
paper.</p>

<p>“‘I did it just now,’ I replied, sheepishly.</p>

<p>“‘What? Do it again.’</p>

<p>“I did so. He looked at me curiously.</p>

<p>“‘Wait a bit,’ he said. He took the paper into the
office. ‘Come in here,’ he said, ‘the boys won’t believe
it. Do some more.’</p>

<p>“‘Davenport,’ said the manager, ‘you are too old to
strike a path for yourself. You must put yourself in
my hands. Do nothing original, not one line.’ If the
manager caught me doing so, he tore it up.</p>

<p>“I remember one time, Ned Hamilton, a star writer
on the ‘Examiner,’ some others, and myself, were
sent to a Sacramento convention. I drew what I considered
very good likenesses, and that night, when I
retired, with a fire burning brightly in the room where
we all bunked, I fairly kicked my heels in delight, in
anticipation of the compliments of the ‘Examiner.’ I
was awakened by the tearing of a paper, that sent the
cold shivers up and down my back. Ned Hamilton
was grumbling, and throwing my labor into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘If you can’t do better than that,’ he said, ‘you
ought to give up.’</p>

<p>“I almost wept, but it took any conceit I might have
had out of me, and the next day I did some work that
was up to the mark.”</p>


<h3>HE WAS DISCHARGED IN CHICAGO.</h3>

<p>“But my walking papers came in due time, and I
went to the ‘Chronicle.’ It almost took my breath
away when they offered me twenty dollars a week.
Before I was discharged from there, I had risen to a
higher salary. I went to Chicago, and got on the
Chicago ‘Herald,’ at thirty-five dollars a week. I was
there during the World’s Fair. It seemed to me the
principal thing I did was to draw horses. But the
greatest blow of all was when the Chicago ‘Herald’
discharged me. It seemed as if everything were slipping
from beneath my feet. I went back to San Francisco
and got on the ‘Chronicle’ again. It was then,
and not till then,—1894,—that I was allowed any
freedom. All that I had been asking an outlet for
found vent, and my cartoons began to attract attention.</p>

<p>“William R. Hearst, of the ‘Examiner,’ asked, in one
of his editorial rooms: ‘Who is that Davenport, on the
”Chronicle,“ who is doing us up all the time?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, we bounced him; he’s no good,’ was the reply.</p>

<p>“‘Send for him!’ said Mr. Hearst.</p>

<p>“No attention was paid to the order. Mr. Hearst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
finally sent for me himself. I was engaged at forty-five
dollars a week. Then a thing happened that I will
never forget, for no raise before or since ever affected
me to such a degree.</p>

<p>“I drew a cartoon of Senator ‘Steve’ White and his
whiskers. The whiskers so pleased Mr. Hearst, that he
called me in and said that my pay would be raised five
dollars a week. I went home that night, and woke up
my wife to tell her the glad news. She fairly wept for
joy, and tears trickled down my own cheeks, for that
increase meant appreciation that I had been starving
for, and I felt almost secure,—and all on account of
Senator ‘Steve’ White’s whiskers.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Davenport, who had brought us two large
books, in which she had fondly pasted all of her husband’s
work, said:—</p>

<p>“Yes, no subsequent increase, no matter how large,
has ever equaled that five-dollar advance.”</p>


<h3>IN CLOVER AT LAST.</h3>

<p>Mr. Hearst, as soon as he bought the New York
“Journal,” telegraphed to the “Examiner:” “Send
Davenport.” He is now receiving a very large salary,
and his work is known throughout the world.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Mr. Davenport went abroad and
drew sketches of the members of the houses of parliament,
and Mr. Phil. May, the English artist, became
his fast friend.</p>

<p>In Washington, Senator Hanna insisted upon meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Mr. Davenport, and shaking him by the hand. He
was the first to immortalize Mr. Hanna, with that
checkered suit of dollar marks.</p>

<p>Such is the man and artist, Homer C. Davenport,
who, in 1894, had not drawn a public cartoon, and who,
to-day, has a world-wide reputation, and the esteem of
even those whom he has caricatured, and who cannot
help enjoying their own exaggerated portraits. Davenport’s
success has come rapidly, but not until he had
sustained reverses that would have discouraged any
man of a less resolute character.</p>

<span class='chaptertitle'>Being Himself in Style and Subjects,
the Secret of an Artist’s Wonderful
Popularity.</span></h2>


<p class='drop-cap'>NOTHING in the studio of Charles Dana Gibson
suggests that it is a studio, excepting the
alien circumstance that it is artistic. Such
proof tends to puzzle the casual-minded,
whose mind is trained to look upon any sky-lighted
room furnished like a pound party, and occupied by
artists, or brokers, or bachelor wholesale dealers,—as
a studio.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson’s studio is a real room, devoted to stern
facts, and is, therefore, beautiful. It has no furniture
that is not essential. Even the large rugs, woven of
moss and mist and fire, hang on the walls like coverings,
and not by way of decoration. The wood is heavy
and dark. There are no pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson talks while he works. His easel stands
squarely beneath the skylight, and, as he sat before it
the other day, a picture grew under his hand while he
talked about the making of an illustrator. Everything
he said was emphasized by the slow growth of the
glorious creature, who was there to show, from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
pretty tilted pompadour to the hem of the undoubted
creation she was wearing, that what the famous illustrator
insisted may be done by skill and hard work can
assuredly be accomplished.</p>

<p>“When anyone asks me,” said Mr. Gibson, “what to
do to become a successful illustrator, I always assure
him that he has thought about the matter and doubtless
knows far more about it than I do, for I know of no
rule to follow to become what one was born to be, and
I certainly know of none to prevent one from failing
at something for which he has no talent.</p>

<p>“If a man knows how to draw, he will draw; and all
the discouragements and all the bad teachers in the
world cannot turn him aside. If he has no ability, he
will drift naturally into school-teaching and buying
stocks, without anybody’s rules to direct him either
way.</p>

<p>“The main thing is to have been born an artist.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson said this quite simply, as if he were advising
a course in something, or five grains of medicine.</p>

<p>“If you were that,” he went on, “you yourself know
it far better than anyone can tell you, and you know
also, in your heart, that neither wrong teaching nor
anything but idleness can prevent your success. If
you are not a born artist, you may not know it. I think
I can soon say something about the way to find your
limitations, but no one can say much to help a born
genius. His genius is largely, indeed, that he knows
how to help himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Lightly leaving the student of illustrating adequately
provided with having been born a genius, Mr. Gibson
went on to tell what should be his education before he
begins to study art, and upon this he put on record an
opinion which is a departure from current belief.</p>


<h3>A NATURAL ARTIST WILL NEVER REQUIRE AN
INSTRUCTOR.</h3>

<p>“I do not think,” he said, “that the previous training
of a student who begins studying illustrating has much
to do with his career. It seems to me that his actual
previous education matters very little. If he wants to
learn, he will learn. If he does not, he will not. If he
does not want to learn, his attempt at an education will
profit him very little. His gift for illustrating, if he
has it, is a thing not more dependent upon his education
than upon his surroundings. While there are instances
in which an education forced upon a pupil has
been acknowledged by him afterward to mean much
to him, there are also cases in all arts of which we say
that contact with the schoolmen would not have been
an advantage.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson said this quite tranquilly, as if it were
not an idea at odds with all other accepted statements
that the thorough education of an artist is the best
foundation for anything he may undertake.</p>

<p>“That leaves a good deal of work for the pupil’s
master,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Master!” exclaimed Mr. Gibson, with almost a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
frown; “what is a master? Have we any masters
now? It seems to me that the word has lost its old
meaning, and that there is no longer such a thing as a
‘master.’ Suppose we say ‘teacher’ instead! And then
let me add this: I do not believe the teacher matters in
the least.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” I demanded, “that a pupil would
make better progress with you for a teacher than he
would with somebody whose work had no value?”</p>


<h3>IF YOU DO NOT SEE YOUR MISTAKES, NO ONE ELSE CAN.</h3>

<p>“Not a bit,” he said, promptly. “To tell the truth,
I think the teaching of drawing is an over-estimated
profession. It doesn’t seem to me as if I could teach,—as
if I would feel it would be exactly honest to teach.
Why, see for yourself,—what can a teacher do?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson laid down his pencil, but he continued
thus:—</p>

<p>“I was for a year at the Art League, and two years
in Paris. In Paris we used to sit in rows at canvases,
like this. We saw our teacher for half an hour, twice
a day. He would come and spend less than two minutes
beside the chair of each of us, and what would he do?
Point out a mistake, or a defect, or, rarely, an excellence,
which, if we had any talent at all, we could see
perfectly well for ourselves. This last is the important
point.</p>

<p>“If you are a born illustrator, you will know your
own mistakes better than anyone can tell you about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
them. If you do not see your mistakes, nobody can ever
help you to be anything. All the teachers in all the art
schools cannot help you if you cannot see your mistakes.
I said I could help a pupil to know his own limitations.
Well, that is the way. If your own work looks
quite finished and perfect to you, or if it looks wrong
but you cannot tell exactly what is the inaccuracy or
lack, you may depend upon it that you were not born
to be an illustrator.</p>

<p>“That is true in anything. The writer, the sculptor
and the musician have to stand this test. What sort
of musician would a man be who could not detect a
discord? You can see it easily enough with that illustration.
Well, your illustrator must see a bad bit of
drawing, or bad composition, just as quickly as a born
piano player can tell if he has played without expression.
It is just as true in art as it is in ordinary
matters. The snow-shoveler must know when his sidewalk
is clean, the typewriter when the words are correctly
spelled, the cook when her pastry tastes right,—or
they are all discharged forthwith. Well, one expects
no less of an illustrator than of a cook.”</p>


<h3>THE VALUE OF ARTISTIC INDIVIDUALITY.</h3>

<p>Mr. Gibson returned to his board, and what he said
next was wonderfully extra-illustrated by the girl—“Gibson”
to her finger-tips,—who looked up at him.</p>

<p>“The whole value of your work is its individuality,”
he said, “and for that you are obliged to depend absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
upon yourself. Obviously nobody can show you
how to be original.</p>

<p>“Now take the simple example of a copy book. Do
you remember how the letters used to look, and the
elaborate directions which accompanied every writing
lesson? The ‘a’s,’ and so on, must be just of a height.
The ‘t’s’ must be twice as high. The ‘l’s’ and the ‘h’s’
must be a quarter-length or so above those. Well, as
a matter of fact, who writes like that? Nobody. If
anyone did he would simply be laughed at, and justly
so. His handwriting would mean nothing. It would
have no individuality. Everybody simply keeps the
letters in mind and forms them to suit himself, and
after a time he has a writing which he can never change
by any chance. That has become the way he writes.</p>

<p>“Well, it is just the same in illustrating. I might
tell you all that I know about drawing; any teacher
might tell you all he knows; but, gradually, by observation
and the assertion of your own personality, you
will modify all these forms, and will find yourself
drawing one special way. That is the way you draw,
and you can never change it in essence, though you
may go on improving it forever.</p>

<p>“Now, to my mind, just so much instruction in drawing
is necessary as is needed to tell the child who is
learning to write which letter is which, and how to
pronounce and recognize it. That once learned, the
child will go its own sweet way and develop a handwriting
such as no one in the world can exactly duplicate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
So it is with drawing. When the first fundamental
instructions are over,—which anyone who can
draw can give you,—you are your own master, and will
draw or not, as you were born to do.</p>

<p>“Remember that I am not saying that I regret the
time I spent studying, either here or in Paris. I am
only telling you what I regard as necessary for one who
wants to learn.</p>

<p>“Now, just as the way to learn to write is to write,
so the way to learn to draw is to draw. I think it is
best to begin with objects in the room, and with figures,—any
objects, any figures,—it does not matter. But
draw one over and over again; draw it from all sides;
draw it big, and draw it little, and draw it again.
Then go to something else, and then come back to it
later the same day. Put them all away till the next
day, and then find the mistakes in them. Here is something
to remember, and something which ought to
hearten many a discouraged student quite blue because
of what really should have encouraged him: Do not
be discouraged at the mistakes you can find in your
own work, unless you find only a small number. The
more mistakes you can detect, the better able you are to
draw. Do not leave a thing until you are satisfied,
after going back to it every day for weeks, that you can
draw it no better. Then, if you come upon it the next
year, and still see no room for improvement,—well,
then there is still room for discouragement about yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHILE STUDYING ART, ONE SHOULD WORK INCESSANTLY.</h3>

<p>“In all this work, observe one rule: Never mind
about drawing a thing as you may possibly have been
told to do in the course of instruction. Draw it the
way it looks to you. You will see it differently as
you go back to it again and again. If you do not see
it differently, you cannot see your own mistakes, and
that is positive proof that for you fame is waiting at
some other door,—or, at any rate, that it will not come
to you from art.</p>

<p>“How much ought one to work? All the time.
Draw all the time. Look all the time for something
to draw. In the beginning, never pass anything without
wresting from it its blessing, so to speak. Before
you pass, be sure you can draw it; and the only way to
be sure of that is to draw it several times. The objects
in a room are a little simpler than figures, at first, but
figures are the most interesting, and you must draw
whatever interests you. If you would rather draw
crawfish and bootjacks than men and women, draw
crawfish and bootjacks. It really doesn’t so much
matter what you draw; the point is that you draw.
But it is important to you that you develop a taste for
drawing something special,—and of that you need
have no fear if you are a born artist. If you are not,
as I said, it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>“I always feel that any general talk about the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
to succeed, in any art one selects, is rather unnecessary.
I cannot repeat too often that I believe, if the student
has it in him to draw, he will not need to be told to
persevere, or to work hard, or to be careful of bad influences
in his work, or to avoid imitation,—he will do
all these as naturally as he will hold a pencil. Holding
a pencil, by the way, is another example of what I just
spoke of. Do you remember that they used to tell us
just how our fingers must hold the pen, and how the
whole arm ought to move? ‘What will they think of
you,’ they said, ‘when you get out in the world, if you
hold your pencil like that?’ As a matter of fact, nobody
gives the matter a thought, and hardly one of us
holds a pencil that way. It is so with many of the
<i>formulae</i> of an art. But isn’t it curious that I never
did get out of holding my pencil that prescribed way?
I do happen to hold my pencil correctly.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you held some of the other <i>formulae</i> the
same way,” I suggested, “and they are influencing
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Mr. Gibson, “so far as the pencil
goes, I fancy, perhaps, that I draw in spite of the way
I hold it rather than because of it.”</p>

<p>Then he made a small retraction of his remark.</p>

<p>“There is one class of teachers,” he said, “that I
count,—pictures. Pictures are always at hand,—and
good work is the best teacher in the world. A pupil
in New York ought to go to the art gallery often and
often, and sit there and steep himself in what he sees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Let him go to study definite pictures, too,—but just to
sit and absorb,—as one sits in a garden, or before an
old tower, or by the sea,—without sketching, only just
looking,—that is the best instruction you can pay for
on either continent.”</p>

<p>The picture of the girl on the board was practically
complete, with its high little chin and haughty mouth
and fearless eyes, and it seemed so alive that getting
to be a great illustrator appeared hopeless by the side
of it.</p>

<p>“How long,” I asked, “does it take, normally, to find
out if you’re a born artist or not?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson laughed and took it the other way.</p>

<p>“A very long time,” he said, regretfully, “and some
of us even go down blind to our graves.”</p>

<p>“May it not be inferred from your idea that the born
illustrator has little need of a teacher, that he also has
little need of a sojourn in the art atmosphere of Paris?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“It certainly may be,” replied Mr. Gibson quickly.
“A young man or woman can now learn just as much
art in some of our great cities, like New York or
Philadelphia, as abroad. Our art schools are as good
as those of Paris. In fact, they are superior in some
respects, and I am very sure that the average American
art student is, in general, better off in the United
States.</p>

<p>“There are, of course, the magnificent galleries of
Europe, with which every artist should be familiar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
but there need be no special hurry to study these. It
is much more advisable, I think, for the young artist
to become imbued with the spirit of our own art, and
to acquire a distinctively American style, before subjecting
himself to the influence of the painters of the
Old World.</p>

<p>“I have little patience with the American who, in
his art, becomes a foreigner. If he does, he is not
accepted as representative either abroad or in this
country. The time has come when a man or woman
may take much pride in being a true American artist.
We are no longer mere imitators. We are forging
ahead into leadership, and I venture to predict that
this century will see New York the art center of the
world.”</p>
